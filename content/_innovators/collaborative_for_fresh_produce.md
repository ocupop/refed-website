description: 'The Collaborative for Fresh Produce''s (CFP) vision is that everyone
  has access to the fresh produce they need to support a healthy lifestyle.  CFP''s
  mission is to fight hunger by fighting food waste through partnerships with America''s
  farming and food bank communities to distribute donations of imperfect and surplus
  produce to those in need. CFP''s programming recovers food that would have otherwise
  been wasted and distributes it to the food insecure.  By partnering with America''s
  farming and food bank communities, CFP has created an innovative, sustainable, and
  scalable model that efficiently distributes fresh produce, a critical part of a
  healthy diet, to communities in need. '

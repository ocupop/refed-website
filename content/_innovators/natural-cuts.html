  "Farther Farms' all-natural process uses a combination of high pressure and
  moderate temperate to extend shelf life.  This delicate balance allows them to
  stop enzymatic and microbial growth throughout the entire vegetable.  Unlike
  other food manufacturers that rely on coatings, sprays, and thermal
  processing, they are able to achieve shelf stability while maintaining fresh,
  pure fruit and vegetable nutrition.  Importantly, Farther Farms’ technique can
  reduce costs at every stage of the food system, from processing, to
  distribution, to final retail.  Removing the need for cold storage eliminates
  burdensome infrastructure requirements, expanding fresh-produce accessibility
  to previously unfeasible destinations and opening new markets for local
  producers.  With wide ranging applications throughout the food industry,
  Farther Farms begins its journey with the Natural Cuts French Fry – a
  fresh-cut, never-frozen French fry -- as it continues to research applications
  to other fruits and vegetables." 








  The science behind Natural Cuts was developed by a team of Cornell University
  food scientists who had themselves experienced the problems caused by the
  relatively short shelf lives of fresh produce. Vipul Saran, one of our
  co-founders and an entrepreneur, has spent a significant portion of his life
  in the agricultural sector both as a scientist and owner of a potato farming
  co-op in India. His empathy for the problems faced by farmers in India and his
  entrepreneurial spirit drove him to commercialize his research into what is
  now Natural Cuts.









  Natural Cuts' offerings seek to solve key pain points for our customers
  through substantially increased shelf-life and reduced caloric value without
  sacrificing product quality. Natural Cuts' products do not require
  refrigeration or freezing, greatly reducing their environmental impact through
  reduced energy utilization.

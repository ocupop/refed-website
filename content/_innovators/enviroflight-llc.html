description: 'EnviroFlight uses the co-product from breweries, ethanol production, and pre-consumer food waste as a feedstock for Black Soldier Fly larvae (Hermetia illucens). The larvae feed off and bioconvert the material. By doing so, the frass — the waste product created by insects after digesting the feedstock — becomes a high protein, low fat feedstuff for omnivorous species such as tilapia, freshwater prawns, catfish.'

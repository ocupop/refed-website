  We’re about building strong local community – both in the neighborhoods where
  we do business and by purchasing as many local products as possible (to keep
  our money in Oregon and help create stronger local economies). In June 2017,
  Salt & Straw will begin an ice cream flavor series focused on rescued food,
  utilizing ingredients that would otherwise be wasted.





  Since 2011, we've opened 4 stores in Portland, OR, 5 in Los Angeles, and 1 in
  San Francisco with a second on it's way as well as an upcoming shop in
  Seattle!

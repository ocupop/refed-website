description: 'Food Cowboy uses mobile technology to help food companies (throughout the supply chain) reduce their carbon footprints by routing wholesome unsaleable food to charities (anywhere in the country) and spoiled food to composters, anaerobic digesters, and other sustainable disposers, instead of to landfills. Its cloud-based systems facilitate scheduling, expedite tax paperwork, and offer food safety guidance so food can be routed appropriately without unacceptable risks or efficiency losses.'

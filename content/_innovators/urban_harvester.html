description: 'Since 2009, weâ€™ve been designing plans, policy, and procedures to address excess professionally made fresh food so it can be donated appropriately. By proper matching, vetting, site visits, advance planning, education and policy, we work to prevent wasted food first, then focus on rescuing safe, edible food for donation.  We connect grocery stores, restaurants and other food providers directly to non-profit agencies reaching from major city centers to communities with limited access to fresh food.'

description: We up-cycle the oilcakes (dry matter left after oil extracted from seeds)
  into human food (chips). Historically, oil cakes have only been used in animal feed
  due to their hard, wood chip-like texture. This hard texture rendered them unappetizing
  for human consumption. We invented a method to re-purpose oil-cakes for human consumption
  where oil cakes are used as the main ingredient. Sunflower oilcake contains 35%
  protein > 22% in bean/chickpea flour and >20% in up-cycled spent grain flour. Sunflower
  chips made from oilcakes contain 20% protein > 17% in ground beef and >14% in chicken
  nuggets. Compared to potato chips, sunflower chips have 3x more protein, 2x more
  fiber and 3x less fat.

  Full Harvest helps growers get the most out of a harvest and food companies
  save money by bringing farm excess to market.





  We are a B2B platform connecting large farms to food & beverage businesses to
  sell discounted, yet perfectly good surplus and imperfectly shaped produce that
  would have otherwise gone to waste.

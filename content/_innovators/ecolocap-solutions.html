  EcoloCap brings together the innovation, engineering, and industry knowledge
  to create products that have a significant—constructive and
  quantifiable—impact on the environment, while being cost-effective.

  The EcoloCap Solutions compost technology redirects all organic waste into a
  valuable byproduct. The byproduct includes organic fertilizers, chicken, fish
  feed, or biomass in the form of a dry powder or pellet that can be efficiently
  stored, transported, and spread.


  We are among the first public companies in North America to offer an effective
  and economical, fully integrated aerobic digestion technology called
  ECOS/Bio-ART which remediates all organic waste. ECOS/Bio-ART is a superior
  and less expensive process than the present anaerobic or aerobic digestion
  methods.

description: Established in 2009, Move For Hunger is the first and only non-profit
  mobilizing relocation professionals to simultaneously fight hunger and food waste
  by collecting unopened, non-perishable food from people who are moving and delivering
  it to local food banks. Move For Hunger has replicated this model across North America
  by developing formalized, innovative food-rescue programs.  Many people throw out
  a good deal of �stuff� when they move; unfortunately, a lot of this �stuff� is food
  that could be delivered to a family in need rather than thrown away.  By teaming
  up with relocation companies across the country, Move For Hunger is creating one
  of the nation's largest year-round service

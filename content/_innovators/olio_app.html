description: 'A free app that connects people with their neighbours so that surplus food from the home can be shared rather than thrown away. Simply upload a photo of your items and neighbours living nearby receive an alert, can request what they want and pop round to pick it up. Our volunteers also collect unsold food from local supermarkets & bakeries at the end of the day and redistribute it to the local community via the app. OLIO is based in the UK, but the app is being used all over the world.'

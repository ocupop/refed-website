description: "In 2013 the marriage of technology (chowmatch) with the evolution of proven models (ie. SF'sfood Runner 1985, Berkeley's daily bread 1982) was put to practice under the direction of Peninsula Food runners (PFR). \n\nPFR is a non profit food recovery organization that services San Mateo and Santa Clara counties by addressing its dual mission of reducing food insecurities and food waste with the engagement of community volunteers. PFR's services has been free to both donors and recipients.\n\nAs of today over 1.6 million lbs of food have been redistributed back into the communities. This coming year, PFR will hire its first back up driver and dispatcher while increasing its recipient base to 200 organizations, all accomplished with the help of over 400 volunteers to service over 300 donors. \n\nPFR growth was accelerated with the help of the technology ChowMatch which streamline the donation process from donors to recipients in real time."

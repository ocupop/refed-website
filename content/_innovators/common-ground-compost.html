  Common Ground Compost is a consulting company that helps set up composting and
  recycling programs for businesses, schools, nonprofits, and residences in New
  York City and beyond. Our goal is to keep edible food from going to waste,
  divert organic waste from landfills, and assist in the development,
  implementation, and growth of waste diversion programs for all. Everything we
  do is based in transparency and education, and we seek to empower our clients
  to make smart and informed decisions by understanding their waste streams.





  Common Ground Compost manages Reclaimed Organics, a program that collects food
  scraps by bicycle in New York City. Our pilot launched in the East Village of
  Manhattan, and has grown to accept material from the West Village, SoHo, and
  the Lower East Side. We collect from residents and businesses, and partner with
  local gardens to create sustainable employment opportunities and support the
  operations of community garden programs.

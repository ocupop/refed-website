description: "Local Roots NYC brings sustainably produced and locally grown food to New Yorkers. As part of this mission, we offer a Farmer's Share: our farmers choose a share of items each week that may be oddly shaped, partially scarred or bruised, or otherwise un-sellable in other markets. We believe this produce is still perfectly delicious and beautiful and sell it to our customers at a discounted rate."

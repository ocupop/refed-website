  Galloping Grace Youth Ranch, a nonprofit working ranch in Rio Rancho New
  Mexico, educates children about ranching, farming and sustainable practices
  through the raising of livestock and the growing of crops. 


  The Ranch has working relationships with area grocery stores, food banks and
  schools to collect over 1 million pounds of food annually that would otherwise
  go to the landfill. The Ranch uses these food scraps to feed their herd of
  cattle, pigs, chickens and goats at the ranch. The livestock are used in youth
  camps, 4-H projects, and a number of youth-focused farm educational programs.
  When the livestock reach finishing weight, they are sent to a local processing
  facility and the meat is subsequently donated back to the regional food bank.
  Recently, in April of this year, GGYR donated 1,500 lbs of pork to the food
  bank.

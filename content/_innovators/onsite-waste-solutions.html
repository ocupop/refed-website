description: "OnSite Waste solutions is a distributor of dehydration technology and equipment that reduces the unavoidable food waste by 85% to 90+%, on-site at the food waste generator's facility. In addition to reducing waste hauling costs due to fewer pickups, it eliminates odor, pests and leaching issues. The resulting two by-products are a highly concentrated organic ( HCO ) that can be reused / recycled as: (i) a soil-like amendment, (II) compost accelerant, (III) animal feed, or (IV) fuel pellet and it generates filtered water ( H2O ) that can be recycled / reused. Lastly, by diverting food waste from our landfills it reduces Greenhouse gas ( GHG ) emissions as well as reducing congestion and damage to our freeways due to fewer waste hauler pickups."

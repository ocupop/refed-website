description: 'Spare Harvest gives new life to waste by connecting neighbours on an interactive P2P marketplace. We believe that when we come together as a community to share, swap or sell what we have spare in our kitchens, gardens and farms, we divert valuable resources away from landfill. There is no excuse for waste as your trash is someone else’s treasure. Share spare plants, food scraps, excess produce, glass jars, compost, honey, eggs, and anything else you have spare. It’s time we wasted less and shared more. Join the Community Waste Revolution.'

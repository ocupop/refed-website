description: Ungraded Produce is a subscription-based produce delivery service on
  a mission to fight food waste and improve food access in North Carolina. We reintegrate
  food waste back into the system by incentivizing farmers to pick and sell their
  �ugly� (i.e. misshapen but high quality) produce, and in turn provide consumers
  with affordable boxes of recovered fruits and vegetables delivered to their door.
  We also donate 2-5 pounds of produce to local food banks for every box sold.

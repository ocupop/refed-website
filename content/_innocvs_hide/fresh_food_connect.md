description: Fresh Food Connect is a app based platform that unlocks the power of
  homegrown food, by creating a platform for backyard and community gardeners to sell,
  trade, or donate their bounty. FFC seeks to reduce food waste and increase access
  to local food by making it easy and convenient for homegrown food to be bought,
  sold, and donated to help address food insecurity. FFC licenses its technology to
  nonprofits and food rescue organizations around the US, who use it to earn revenue
  while creating a more local and less wasteful food system.

description: ORCA diverts unavoidable food waste, like prep waste and leftovers, from
  landfill where it would decompose and release methane into the air. ORCA uses microbiology
  and aerobic digestion to turn the food waste into an effluent that is discharged
  into existing infrastructure (the sanitary sewer system) to transport the food waste.
  This alternative transportation method eliminates the need for garbage trucks, and
  the associated diesel gas fumes emitted, to pick up the food waste from your organization.

definition: "Opening retail stores and creating dedicated market environments to sell discounted groceries sourced from food manufacturers and distributors"


challenges:
  - Businesses benefit from reliable product procurement and must understand trends in manufacturing and distribution to anticipate changes in market supply
  - The discount grocery industry has low margins, requiring reliable demand and efficient operations to achieve a profit.
  - The build out of a typical retail store and initial losses during the first year of launch typically require a multi-million dollar investment per store. 

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Stores</strong> can scale slowly to improve their understanding of consumer demand and local needs to identify how to efficiently grow.
  - <strong>Government</strong> and <strong>foundation</strong> loans can help secondary resellers expand to lower-income neighborhoods with less access to fresh foods, thus helping to address higher food insecurity; nonprofits can lend expertise in analyzing these regions.

    description: "<a href='https://groceryoutlet.com' target='_blank'>Grocery Outletâ€™s</a> 225 retail stores, based primarily on the West Coast, work with manufacturers to understand their particular waste issues (the top reason is short-coded products near expiration) and come up with a custom distribution path."

    description: "<a href='http://dailytable.org' target='_blank'>Daily Table</a>, located in Dorchester, Mass., is a not-for-profit retail store offering fresh, healthy &quot;grab-n-go&quot; meals and other grocery items at a bargain price. These bargain deals are available because Daily Table works closely with a large network of growers, supermarkets, manufacturers, and other suppliers who donate their excess healthy food and provide special buying opportunities."

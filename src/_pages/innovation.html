          <p>Incremental innovation will lower the cost and improve the performance of many Roadmap solutions. Advancements in materials will drive innovation around packaging, while new mobile apps will improve the effectiveness of Consumer Awareness Campaigns and Donation Matching Software. Numerous plant-level innovations around Centralized Composting and AD will drive down processing costs and improve the quality of outputs.</p>

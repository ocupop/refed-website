              <li><strong>Consumer Education</strong></li>
              <li>Consumer Education Campaigns are among the most cost-effective and scalable <em>Roadmap</em> solutions because they directly influence food purchasing and eating behaviors. Consumer education is also critical to spurring consumer demand for smarter offerings at grocery retailers and restaurants, including Standardized Date Labeling, Spoilage Prevention Packaging, Imperfect Produce, and Trayless Dining.</li>

              <li>In 2016, NRDC and the Ad Council launched <a href="http://savethefood.com">Save the Food</a> the first widespread public service campaign promoting food waste awareness, similar to a program launched in the UK in recent years. This campaign must be expanded, measured, and improved over time.</li>

              <li><strong>Employee Education</strong></li>
              <li>For food businesses, half of ReFEDâ€™s solutions require hands-on employee involvement in day-to-day execution, which is challenging given high turnover rates in the sector. Training is needed to avoid the removal of product from shelves when it is still safe and edible, identify food that can be donated, and properly source-separate scraps to remove contaminants for recycling. The quickest path to widespread employee training would be to link a new Food Waste Certification to existing Food Safety Certification programs, as they are already mandatory in many food businesses and are a top priority for management teams.</li>

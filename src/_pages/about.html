          <h2>About ReFED</h2>
          <p class="col2">
            ReFED is a collaboration of over thirty business, nonprofit, foundation and government leaders committed to reducing United States food waste in the United States. ReFED seeks to unlock new philanthropic and investment capital, along with technology, business and policy innovation, to achieve this goal, which will catalyze tens of thousands of new jobs, recover billions of meals annually for the hungry, and reduce national water use and greenhouse gas emissions. ReFED was formed in early 2015 to create a Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste, the first ever national economic study and action plan driven by a multistakeholder group committed to tackling food waste at scale. Recently, a number of initiatives have raised awareness of the magnitude of the problem. The Roadmap is designed to fill the gap between awareness and action, by creating transparency in the waste flows, costs and opportunities of a more efficient food system achieved by preventing, recovering, and recycling food waste. The Roadmap is the result of a collaborative stakeholder process, including input and support from ReFED members and over 80 additional industry experts.

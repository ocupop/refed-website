          <p class="col2 editable">ReFED is a multi-stakeholder nonprofit, powered by an influential network of the nation&rsquo;s leading business, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing U.S. food waste. ReFED takes a data-driven approach to move the food system from acting on instinct to insights to solve our national food waste problem. Solutions already exist to cut food waste by 20% nationwide. ReFED has identified 27 of the best opportunities through the <a href="http://refed.com/roadmap"><em>Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste</em></a>, a first-of-its-kind economic analysis, making it easier for stakeholders across the food supply chain to meet the national 50% reduction goal by 2030. The ReFED <em>Roadmap</em> revolutionized the way the industry looks at food waste -- looking beyond challenges and identifying concrete opportunities to save money and resources, feed people, and create jobs. ReFED&rsquo;s continued efforts include promoting date label standardization through a multi-stakeholder initiative; collecting data and generating insights on the innovation taking place to reduce food waste; and centralizing food waste policies at the state and Federal level. These tools help businesses, nonprofits, government, and investors put the most impactful solutions to reduce food waste into action</p>

            <p>Many food manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, strong federal and state liability protections exist for businesses and nonprofits that provide or receive donated food. <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ210/pdf/PLAW-104publ210.pdf" target="_blank">The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</a> provides a federal baseline of protection for food donors. It covers individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, the o cers of businesses and nonprofit organizations, and gleaners.</p>

            <h4>The Emerson Act protections apply so long as the following criteria are met:</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Donation Recipient: The donor must donate to a nonprofit organization that distributes the donated food to needy populations. Direct donations from the donor to needy individuals do not seem to be protected by the Act.</li>
              <li>Good Faith: The donations must be made in good faith.</li>
              <li> Qualifying Foods: The donor must donate qualifying foods, unless specific reconditioning steps have been taken. Qualifying foods are those that meet “all quality and labeling standards imposed by Federal, State, and local laws and regulations,” even if they are not “readily marketable due to appearance, age, freshness, grade, size, surplus, or other conditions.” State and local quality and labeling laws vary, and donors should be aware of requirements specific to their state or locality since the Emerson Act does not protect donations that are not in compliance with those laws.
                <ul>
                  <li>Exception for Non-Qualifying Food: If a food does not meet all applicable federal, state, and local standards, the donor can still be protected by the Emerson Act as long as (s)he follows all of the Act’s reconditioning procedures,ix which include:
                    <ul>
                      <li>The donor informs the nonprofit of the nonconforming nature of the product;</li>
                      <li>The nonprofit agrees to recondition the item so that it is compliant; and</li>
                      <li>The nonprofit knows the standards for reconditioning the item.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>No Charge for Food: The ultimate recipients cannot pay for the donated food.xiii However, if one nonprofit donates food to another nonprofit for distribution, the Act allows the first nonprofit to charge the distributing nonprofit a nominal fee to cover handling and processing costs.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>What Types of Donations are not Covered by the Emerson Act</h4>
            <p>So long as the above criteria are met, the Emerson Act is quite protective of donors, and does not hold a donor liable unless the donor acts with gross negligence or intentional misconduct.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Gross Negligence</strong> involves “voluntary and conscious conduct (including a failure to act)” by a person or organization that knew when the donation was made that the donated food was likely to have harmful health impacts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Intentional Misconduct</strong> is when a person or organization donates “with knowledge . . . that the conduct is harmful to the health or well-being of another person.”
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In other words, one should not donate or facilitate the distribution of donated food that one knows is likely to be harmful or dangerous. Unfortunately, the Act gives little guidance on what activities qualify as gross negligence or intentional misconduct. However, the House of Representatives Report associated with the Emerson Act has indicated that each case must be analyzed individually, and that, for example, donating food past the sell-by date generally will be protected because such labeling is not federally required and generally does not correspond to food safety.xviii The lack of court cases interpreting the Emerson Act suggests how protective the Act is of donors; research does not turn up a single case related to food donation liability.</p>
            <p>In addition to federal liability protections, states are free to enact state level liability protections that are more protective of food donors than the federal Emerson Act.</p>

            <h3>Recommendations for strengthening federal policy</h3>
            <p>The broad base of liability protection provided by the Emerson Act was intended to encourage food donations, yet donors are often unaware of it. Further, several provisions in the Act should be broadened to better align with the current food recovery landscape. Clarifying the Emerson Act’s coverage and expanding its protections, as described below, can boost more food donations. Most of these suggestions, put forth by NRDC and the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, would require Congressional action to modify the Act’s language. However, a federal agency can take action immediately to clarify the Emerson Act by providing interpretive guidance.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>An executive agency should be responsible for implementing and interpreting the Emerson Act.</li>
              <li>Congress should broaden the language of the Emerson Act to protect nonprofit organizations that sell food at a discounted price and the donors that donate to these nonprofits.</li>
              <li>Congress should modify the language of the Emerson Act to include donations made by food service establishments and retailers directly to individuals.
              </li>
              <li>Congress should modify the Emerson Act to cover food mislabeled in ways that are irrelevant to food safety. The executive agency designated to interpret the act should issue guidance on which labels are relevant to food safety.</li>
              <li>Congress should modify the language of the Emerson Act to explicitly cover past-date food.</li>
            </ol>

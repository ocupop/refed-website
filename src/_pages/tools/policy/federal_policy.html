        <h3>Federal Liability Protection</h3>
        <p>Many food manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, strong federal and state liability protections exist for businesses and nonprofits that provide or receive donated food. The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act provides a federal baseline of protection for food donors. It covers individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, the officers of businesses and nonprofit organizations, and gleaners. </p>

        <h3>Federal Tax Incentives</h3>
        <p>The federal government has recognized the importance of food donation and provides tax deductions to incentivize businesses to donate food. As of December 2015, all businesses—including C-corporations, S-corporations, limited liability corporations (LLCs), partnerships and sole proprietorships—are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction that exceeds the property’s basis for donated food if they meet certain requirements. If they do not meet the requirements, they can still claim a general tax deduction in the amount of the property’s basis.</p>

        <h2>Recycling Policy</h2>
        <h3>Federal Animal Feed Policy</h3>
        <p>Under federal law, food scraps can generally be fed to animals, so long as food scraps with animal derived by-products are heat-treated by a licensed facility before being fed to swine; and food scraps containing animal-derived by-products are not fed to ruminants. Both the federal government and state governments regulate the use of food scraps in animal feed. The federal regulations function as a floor, and most state regulations go beyond them.</p>

        <h3>The Food Recovery Act</h3>
        <p>The Food Recovery Act was introduced to Congress on Dec. 8, 2015, with the intent to significantly reduce the amount of food wasted at all levels of the food value chain. Provisions include regulations and funding that will raise awareness, increase incentives and infrastructure for food donation, encourage composting and food waste to energy programs, and reduce wasted food in schools and the federal government.</p>

        <h3>Food Date Labeling Act</h3>
        <p>No national uniform system for food date labeling exists in the U.S. In the absence of federal law, states enforce a variety of inconsistent date label regulations. The Food Date Labeling Act was proposed to the House and Senate on May 18, 2016, with the intent of establishing a uniform national system for date labeling that clearly distinguishes between foods that bear a label indicating peak quality from foods that bear a label indicating they may become unsafe to consume past the date. This bill would also ensure that food is allowed to be sold or donated after its quality date, and educate consumers about the meaning of new labels so that they can make better economic and safety decision.</p>

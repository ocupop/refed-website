          <h1>Current Federal Policy</h1>
          <h3>Federal Liability Protection</h3>
          <p class="editable">Many food manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, strong federal liability protections exist for businesses and nonprofits that receive donated food. In 1996, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act, which provides a federal floor of civil and criminal liability protection for food donors and nonprofit organizations that receive and distribute food donations to those in need as long as certain requirements are met.</p>

          <h3>Federal Tax Incentives</h3>
          <p class="editable">Tax incentives make food donation more cost effective and economically beneficial. The federal government has recognized the importance of food donation and provides tax deductions for food donations to incentivize businesses to donate food. As of December 2015, all businesses&mdash;including C-corporations, S-corporations, limited liability corporations (LLCs), partnerships,and sole proprietorships&mdash;are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction for food donations that exceed the property&rsquo;s basis, which is usually its cost to the business, for donated food if they meet certain requirements. If they do not meet the requirements, they can still claim qualify for a general tax deduction in the amount of the property&rsquo;s basis.</p>

          <h3>Federal Animal Feed Policy</h3>
          <p class="editable">The use of food waste as animal feed has been commonplace for centuries. This practice declined in the 1980s, when state and federal laws tried to limit the feeding of food waste to animals following several disease outbreaks linked to animal products in livestock feed. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the practice of feeding safe, properly treated food waste to animals.The federal government regulates the use of food scraps in animal feed by setting requirements which largely concern the type of animals that may be fed food scraps and the kind of food scraps that may be fed to animals. The federal regulations function as a floor that allows state regulations to go beyond them. &nbsp;</p>

          <h1>Proposed Federal Policy</h1>
          <h3>The Food Recovery Act</h3>
          <p class="editable">Congresswoman Chellie Pingree introduced HR484, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4184/text">Food Recovery Act</a> to Congress on Dec. 8, 2015, which is a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at reducing food waste and promoting food recovery. The Food Recovery Act includes various provisions to encourage farms, groceries, restaurants and institutions to donate excess food to food recovery nonprofits, regulations and funding measures that will raise awareness, encourage composting and food waste to energy programs, and reduce wasted food in schools and the federal government. The Food Recovery Act has also been introduced in the Senate and is sponsored by U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai&lsquo;i), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).</p>

          <h3>Food Date Labeling Act</h3>
          <p class="editable">No national uniform system for food date labeling exists in the U.S. In the absence of federal law, states enforce a variety of inconsistent date label regulations. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s2947/BILLS-114s2947is.pdf" target="_blank">Food Date Labeling Act</a> was proposed to the House and Senate on May 18, 2016, with the intent of establishing a uniform national system for date labeling that clearly distinguishes between foods that bear a label indicating peak quality from foods that bear a label indicating they may become unsafe to consume past the date. This bill would also ensure that food is allowed to be sold or donated after its quality date, and educate consumers about the meaning of new labels so that they can make better economic and safety decision.</p>

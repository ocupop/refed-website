          <p>No national uniform system for date labeling exists in the U.S., which allows companies to use a dizzying array of labels, including “sell by,” “use by,” “best by,” and “expires on.” These dates are set by manufacturers and are not intended to communicate safety information. Instead, they signal a manufacturer's estimate of how long food will taste its best. However, consumers mistakenly believe that these dates are indicators of safety. 90% of Americans have reported throwing food away on the expiration date due to fear of safety risks.</p>
          <p>In the absence of federal law, states enforce a variety of inconsistent date label regulations. Forty-one states require date labels on certain products. However, these states do not distinguish between quality and safety and do not require clear, standard label language. Twenty states even restrict or ban the sale or donation of past-date food, leading to unnecessary waste of healthy, safe food.</p>
          <p>The standardization of date labels is the most economically efficient way to reduce food waste. Standardizing date labels could divert 398,000 tons of food waste per year and provide an annual economic value of $1.8 billion.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s2947/BILLS-114s2947is.pdf">Food Date Labeling Act</a> was proposed to the House and Senate on May 18, 2016, with the intent of establishing standard federal rules for the dates on food labels. The bill aims to reduce consumer confusion, simplify regulatory compliance for companies, and cut supply-chain and consumer waste of food and money. The bill:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Establishes a uniform national system for date labeling that clearly distinguishes between foods that bear a label indicating peak quality from foods that bear a label indicating they may become unsafe to consume past the date;</li>
            <li>Ensures that food is allowed to be sold or donated after its quality date; and</li>
            <li>Provides for educating consumers about the meaning of new labels so that they can make better economic and safety decision.</li>
          </ul>

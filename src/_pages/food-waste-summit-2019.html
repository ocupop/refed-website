            <p>The 2019 Food Waste Summit, hosted by ReFED, is this year’s premier event that will gather influential thought leaders
            and decision makers from across the private, public and nonprofit sectors to focus on food loss and waste. For two
            days, invited attendees will share and discuss strategies to achieve our common goal to cut food waste in half by 2030,
            and the opportunities to generate profits, increase food security, spur economic growth and protect the environment.
            Drawing on ReFED’s data-driven, solutions-oriented analysis and multistakeholder network, the 2019 Food Waste
            Summit is the only event that brings together the necessary stakeholders to unlock this $100 billion+ opportunity.</p>
            <p>This invitation-only event will bring together leaders and practitioners from food businesses, investors, national
            nonprofits, government, solution providers, and academia who have a shared interest in sustainable food systems.</p>

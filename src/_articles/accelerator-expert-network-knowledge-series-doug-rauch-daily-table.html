              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Doug Rauch, former President of Trader Joe's and Founder of the innovative retail nonprofit, Daily Table.</p>
              <p>Doug&rsquo;s 31 years of experience growing Trader Joe&rsquo;s Company from a small, nine-store chain to a nationally acclaimed retail success story paved the way for his market-savvy approach to tackling food insecurity with Daily Table. Determined to find a scalable, dignified response to hunger, Doug developed a nonprofit retail storefront business model that sells surplus, high quality food from manufacturers, distributors and growers at a deep discount. By removing the economic barrier to healthy food and making good food competitive in price with fast food, Daily Table wins the repeat patronage of their customers and consistently provides excellent products at affordable prices.</p>
              <p>With plans to expand this model to more stores in the Boston area, Doug is looking to redesign tax incentive policies so that food recovery is encouraged throughout the food industry, and calls upon social entrepreneurs to continue applying their innovative business ideas and technologies to help alleviate food insecurity within their communities.</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen sat down with Doug to understand how he has applied lessons from his extensive retail career to build an enjoyable shopping experience that promotes dignity and helps low-income customers access nutritious, affordable food.</p>

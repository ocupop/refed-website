              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Doug Rauch, Founder of the innovative retail nonprofit Daily Table that tackles hunger and obesity by using excess, high quality food that would otherwise go to waste. Doug&rsquo;s 31 years of experience helping grow Trader Joe&rsquo;s Company from a small, nine-store chain to a nationally acclaimed retail success story paved the way for his market-savvy approach towards tackling food insecurity. Determined to find a scalable, dignified response to hunger, Doug developed the business model of a nonprofit retail storefront that sells surplus food from manufacturers, distributors and growers at a deep discount. By removing the economic barrier to healthy food and making good food competitive in price with fast food, Daily Table wins the repeat patronage of their customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. With his eyes on expanding to more stores in the Boston area, Doug is looking towards influencing tax incentive policies so that food recovery is encouraged throughout the food industry, and calls on social entrepreneurs to continue testing their technologies and innovative business ideas to better solve the problems within our communities.</p>
              <p>Amy Ahearn from +Acumen sat down with Doug to understand how he has applied lessons from his extensive retail career to build an enjoyable shopping experience that promotes dignity and helps low-income customers access nutritious, affordable food.</p>

In early 2018, ReFED published a series of sector-specific Food Waste Action Guidesâ€”tools to help organizations understand the impact of food waste and drive action to prevent it. Since then, food businesses across the country have been making bold commitments and taking impressive action to address this waste in their operations and throughout their supply chains.

In these webinars, ReFED hosts grocery, restaurant, and foodservice leaders to discuss insights from the Food Waste Action Guides as well as the business case for and the successes they've seen from implementing food waste solutions.&nbsp;

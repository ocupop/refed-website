              <p>In June 2019, ReFED launched an Open Call for Applications to the Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator, a three-month program designed to help food recovery organizations build capacity and become operationally sustainable. The Accelerator's one-of-a-kind, highly customized curriculum will combine a virtual classroom with in-person ReFED Learning Labs that focus on co-creating earned revenue models and technology-enabled solutions using human centered-design.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>After a month, more than 120 candidates responded to the Open Call, representing a range of maturity, models, size, clients serviced, and so on. We encourage you to check out these <a target="_blank" href="/ReFED - Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator Open Call Analytics vFINAL - 2019-07-19.pdf">2-page analytics sheet</a> that provides anonymized information on our applicant pool. We're thrilled with the response we received and feel confident that the selected cohort will help accomplish our goal of doubling the amount of healthy food rescued for the 40 million food insecure Americans.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>

Food recovery is the primary source of food supply for hunger relief organizations in the U.S. In 2017,, more than 72% of Feeding America’s 4.2 billion meals provided were supplied by recovered food. Although philanthropic capital continues to play a critical function in supporting nonprofit food recovery efforts (in fact, $124 million in philanthropic foundation funding as of 2016), these organizations are seeing a benefit in diversifying their funding to include complementary earned revenue.

Historically, recovery efforts have been led by non-profit, highly localized organizations with a heavy reliance on volunteer labor and philanthropic support that’s not often scaled to the regional or national level. With nearly 40 million Americans facing food insecurity, and with efforts increasing to serve these individuals and families healthier foods, recovery organizations are working to improve their ability to meet the needs of their clientele, all while striving to capture a growing supply of surplus food from diverse groups of donors. Funding these vital but complex recovery and distribution networks often requires non-profit organizations to innovate on the traditional food bank model.

While some organizations are raising the capital to manage and scale their operations, others like LA Kitchen have unfortunately faced insurmountable funding obstacles and have been forced to permanently close their doors. Stating that the loss of a large contract left LA Kitchen without sufficient funding to remain in operation, founder Robert Egger acknowledged that their lack of a balanced funding mix between philanthropic funding and earned income ultimately could not sustain their work.

Many food recovery nonprofits are integrating revenue streams beyond grants and donations into their funding models, oftentimes with the added benefit of creating more jobs and increasing food recovery capacity.

### Why Expand Beyond Grants?

ReFED tracks over 500 for-profit and nonprofit U.S. food waste innovators in its Innovator Database. Over 20% of these innovators are dedicated to food recovery operations, and 86% of these food recovery innovators are nonprofit organizations largely reliant on charitable contributions. Commonly-cited bottlenecks for scaling food recovery programs are the time and resources associated with applying to grants and the difficulty in funding staff time or general operating support.

Food Forward’s Founder and Executive Director Rick Nahmais also identifies the difficulties in making long-term plans and investments when relying 100% on grants in ReFED’s most recent Innovator Spotlight stating, “many of the grants available for food recovery come with significant restrictions or without a holistic understanding of all that goes into the work we do.” Reducing an organization’s reliance on traditional annual grant cycles could free up time spent on fundraising allowing organizations to be more strategic, operate sustainably, and maintain programs that might not otherwise receive funding from philanthropic donors.

Given the importance and need for recovery organizations to be able to continue their work in a sustainable manner, ReFED is encouraged by the new generation of food recovery nonprofits that are developing sustainable funding models to capture and redistribute nearly 1.7M tons of food annually around the country. Through our work with food recovery innovators, ReFED has identified number of strategies for diversifying these revenue streams, offering some viable examples for organizations looking beyond grants to fund their operations.

### Innovative Earned Income Models

#### *Fee-for-Service Food Manufacturing and Shared Community Kitchen Services at CommonWealth Kitchen*

&nbsp;

CommonWealth Kitchen, a Boston-based food waste innovator founded in 2009, offers shared kitchens and business development assistance to help aspiring entrepreneurs build new food companies. Using this model, over 60 tons of surplus produce were processed in 2018 for more than a dozen farms and manufacturing customers. As one of the leading food business incubators and urban food manufacturing hubs in Massachusetts, CommonWealth Kitchen earns income from:

* Shared kitchen rental and warehousing;
* Fee-for-service manufacturing for members, farms, wholesalers and anchor institutions;
* Retail operation for food trucks and caterers;
* Fees for classes, workshops and tours.

CommonWealth Kitchen credits the collaboration among its member companies, including pooling technical knowledge, networks and best practice sharing, as a key foundation of its success and growth in recent years. Tripling in size in just 10 years, CommonWealth Kitchen plans to scale operations as they find new retail and wholesale markets and grow their institutional food service program.

#### *Community Supported Agriculture Program and New Product Creation at 412 Food Rescue*

412 Food Rescue, a Pittsburgh-based food rescue organization founded in 2014, utilizes their app “Food Rescue Hero” to alert volunteers of available food and coordinate pickups and deliveries within a central technology platform. The surplus produce recovered from this streamlined approach to food collection has enabled 412 Food Rescue to launch a new Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, which creates new markets for previously unsellable produce. This program provides subscribers a weekly box of “ugly” produce and locally sourced items for $20/week. This program runs for 12 weeks during the peak growing season, during a time when surplus produce is most abundant.

Additionally, 412 Food Rescue partners with local food and drink manufacturers to create innovative products from food that would otherwise be wasted. Surplus bread is used to make craft beer in collaboration with a local brewery, and rescued apples are used to make a liqueur in collaboration with a local distillery. Mulberries collected from city trees through their Hidden Harvest program have been used to create a new flavor of ice cream in collaboration with a local creamery. A portion of sales from each of these innovative products goes back to 412 Food Rescue as a source of earned income.

#### *Web-Based Food Donation Platform Charging Pickup Fees at Replate*

Replate, a Berkeley-based innovator founded in 2016, describes themselves as a tech nonprofit aiming to break the mold of a traditional recovery organization by acting as the Uber for prepared food recovery, incorporating strategies utilized in the sharing economy to fight hunger.

By charging a fee for streamlined, reliable food pickups and assuming all responsibility for collecting the donated food, the Replate platform makes it convenient for food businesses and corporate offices to donate food consistently and without fear of liability. Through this funding, Replate has created 46 new jobs to support its food recovery work.

Replate offers the option for business customers to pay for a single, on-demand food pickup or a set number of pickups per month, which includes all food service handling and transportation services. Donors can claim charitable deductions for their donated food, while the Replate platform makes it easy for users to calculate the estimated financial savings of their donations by documenting donations in one central database. Combining the ease and efficiency of mobile apps with a quality service many are willing to pay for, Replate demonstrates how tech-enabled recovery services can reach new markets and recover more fresh, prepared food for its beneficiaries.

### Vision for the Next Generation of Food Recovery

By ReFED’s estimates, today’s food recovery sector has the potential to increase by 1.8B meals annually. This would nearly double the amount of meals rescued today, diverting an additional 1.1M tons of perfectly safe and nutritious food from ending up in the landfill. Achieving this potential will require:

1. More food donors willing to pay for the services provided to them, in return receiving value in the form of tax savings, reductions to waste management costs, stronger ties to their community and positive social and environmental benefits to their brand. Nonprofit does not mean non-revenue.
2. Utilizing existing infrastructure and technologies in new ways to improve operational efficiencies and to improve capacity to capture new sources of food donations (e.g., shifting away from canned foods towards fresh, prepared foods and produce surpluses on farms).

3. Best practice sharing among food recovery organizations to overcome common obstacles as localized networks become more connected (e.g., addressing food safety concerns, maintaining a reliable workforce of paid and unpaid labor to operate recovery efforts, and acquiring sufficient cold chain and warehousing facilities to manage the geographic and temporal variability of donations).

The next generation of food recovery requires a coordinated effort among food donors, capital providers, and food recovery organizations. ReFED is excited to see more nonprofits experiment and operationalize innovative strategies for achieving financial sustainability and impact at scale.

              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Hannah Koski, Director of Procurement and Sustainability at Blue Apron, where she discusses how their innovative and human-centered business model reduces food waste while improving access to high-quality ingredients.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Blue Apron&rsquo;s mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible with delicious step-by-step recipes and high-quality ingredients. Hannah shares that the company&rsquo;s model, from when it was founded in 2012, is to reduce its food waste impact through an optimized farm-to-fork supply chain that distributes pre-portioned fresh and seasonal ingredients to customers, therefore minimizing household food surplus. Having worked at Blue Apron for four years in a variety of roles related to sustainability, Hannah takes pride in spearheading food waste reduction and recovery programs that have reduced waste by more than 50 percent across their facilities and that also incorporate customer insights into product design to ensure dignity for end recipients. Currently, Hannah serves as Blue Apron&rsquo;s Director of Procurement and Sustainability.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Hannah enthusiastically elaborates that Blue Apron has gone a step further in its commitment to support food systems change as members of the inaugural cohort of the <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste/champions#current">U.S. Food Waste and Loss 2030 Champions</a>. Key to Blue Apron&rsquo;s success and a lesson Hannah shares from her experience, is in understanding the needs of stakeholders to build authentic brand value which offers valuable insight for product design. In addition, Hannah sees the importance for non-profits to set short and realistic milestones along the roadmap towards achieving their ultimate goal.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen sat down with Hannah to learn more about her work and the lessons she thinks food recovery nonprofits might be able to draw from Blue Apron&rsquo;s innovative and customer-centric model.</p>

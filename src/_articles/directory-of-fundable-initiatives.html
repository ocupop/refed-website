              <p>COVID-19 has sent shock waves through our entire food system, from producers to end recipients. Closures of restaurants and bars, furloughed and laid-off employees, and stay-at-home orders in more than 40 states have led to a spike in demand for services in the grocery retail and technology sectors. Meanwhile, food donations have become unpredictable at best, and there is an increasingly vital need for food access and distribution services, especially among food security and recovery organizations.</p>
              <p>To scale up the most impactful responses to the crisis, the need for funding is urgent &mdash; not just to address immediate problems, but to position these organizations to meet the ever-growing demand for services moving forward.</p>
              <p>ReFED's&nbsp;<em>Directory of Fundable Initiatives</em>&nbsp;provides details on organizations that need support right now to enact new safety measures, hire more drivers, establish &ldquo;rapid response&rdquo; services, conduct direct distribution to those in need, build new partnerships to facilitate their ongoing outreach, and more.</p>
              <p>Please contact these organizations directly if you identify an initiative to provide support. If you would like more information on a fundable initiative - or to share additional opportunities - please email&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="mailto:Angel.Veza@refed.com">Angel.Veza@refed.com</a>.</p>

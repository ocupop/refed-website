Dear ReFED Community,

This summer has been an exciting time of growth and progress, both for ReFED and in the effort to reduce wasted food at scale. We have developed new programs around food business engagement, capital and innovation, and are growing our team.<br><br>On Wednesday, ReFED, [Food Tank](https://foodtank.com/), and [Rockefeller Foundation](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/) are co-hosting [Focusing on Food Loss and Food Waste: 2017 Food Tank Summit NYC](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/focusing-on-food-loss-and-food-waste-2017-food-tank-summit-nyc-tickets-31681070936). This one-day event features over 40 food system experts, entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, writers, chefs, nonprofits, businesses, and government representatives. The entire event was streamed on&nbsp;[Facebook Live](https://www.facebook.com/rethinkfoodwaste).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>As we move into fall, look out for the release of our Stakeholder Action Guides for restaurants, retail, and foodservice companies and updates on the formal launch of our Funder’s Collaborative!<br>&nbsp;<br>Sincerely,<br>&nbsp;<br>Chris Cochran<br>Executive Director, ReFED<br>**__****__****__****__**<br><br>&nbsp;<br>**ReFED in Action**<br>**&nbsp;<br>On The Hill**<br>Following the release of *[Opportunities to Reduce Food Waste in the 2018 Farm Bill](http://www.chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Opportunities-to-Reduce-Food-Waste-in-the-2018-Farm-Bill_May-2017.pdf)*, ReFED joined [Food Policy Action](http://foodpolicyaction.org/), [Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic](http://www.chlpi.org/food-law-and-policy/), and celebrity chefs in Washington D.C. to brief congressional representatives and staffers on the importance of addressing food waste through common sense policies. We discussed federal policy priorities, including date label standardization, increased on-farm food recovery, expanded donation liability protections, and support for organic waste bans.

<br>**Progress on Date Labeling Standardization**<br>Current date labeling practices cause confusion, leading to an estimated 20% of consumer waste. [ReFED's Date Labeling Working Group](http://%20http//www.refed.com/solutions/standardized-date-labeling){: .cc-active} consulted with more than 40 food safety experts to develop a [beta version of a tool](http://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED-Standardization-Package.pdf)&nbsp;to promote the accelerated adoption of the Grocery Manufacturers Association and Food Marketing Institute's [voluntary commitment to standardize date labels](http://www.gmaonline.org/news-events/newsroom/grocery-industry-launches-new-initiative-to-reduce-consumer-confusion-on-pr/) by helping manufacturers determine which label to use for different products. Standardized date labels are expected to address over $2 billion of wasted consumer spending every year.

Your own data speaks volumes of what you can do.

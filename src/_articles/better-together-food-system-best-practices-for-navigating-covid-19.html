              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how food waste solution providers and food businesses must operate to safely do their work. What are the new challenges they&rsquo;re facing? What can they be doing to overcome them? And what can they learn from others who are successfully adapting their operations to this new reality?</p>
              <p>ReFED is grateful to all those who participated in our recently concluded discussion series,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://covid.refed.com/webinars">Better Together: Food System Best Practices for Navigating COVID-19</a>.&nbsp;</em>Over 450 of you tuned in live and hundreds more have watched discussion recordings. The initial five topics, covered in this series, represent the biggest challenges highlighted by friends of ReFED from across the food system. While each challenge is unique, they share a common solution: collaboration. In each installment, our <a target="_blank" href="https://covidstaging.refed.com/panelists">panelists</a> highlighted that the best way we can overcome this crisis is by reaching out to, helping, and getting help from each other. It won&rsquo;t be easy. But from sharing assets and safety procedures to creating corporate-startup partnerships &mdash; and many more great ideas in between &mdash; we&rsquo;ll fare better together than we would apart.</p>

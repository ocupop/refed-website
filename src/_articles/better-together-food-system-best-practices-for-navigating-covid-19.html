              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how food waste solution providers and food businesses must operate to safely do their work. What are the new challenges they&rsquo;re facing?

              <p><strong>April 15 - LOGISTICS:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>USE IDLE ASSETS&nbsp;</strong>// Many organizations have stopped operations by choice or by law; that could mean they have idle assets like trucks, refrigerators, and kitchens available for use. Think about what you need and think outside the box about who may have it. Barbara, for example, is using idle trucks and drivers from a party tent rental company and municipalities.</p>
              <p><strong>SIMPLIFY</strong>&nbsp;// Our work in these chaotic times can be made easier by simplifying what we do. SKU rationalization &mdash; reducing the number of products you carry &mdash; is a great place to start. Tim also highlighted that simplified rules, from produce specifications to federal regulations, have already helped turn food surpluses into viable supplies.</p>
              <p><strong>FIND NEW CHANNELS&nbsp;</strong>// With the unpredictable supply and demand of food, new channels have proven to be successful in preventing food from being wasted. Convenience stores now carry fresh produce items; broadliners are supplying retailers; restaurants are selling fresh produce, meat, and essentials like TP directly to consumers; and foodservice companies are working with food recovery organizations to break up large pallets of food and distribute it.&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>PARTNER&nbsp;</strong>// Sueli highlighted the importance of partnerships. DoorDash and United Way have&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=76de6fbe60&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">partnered</a>&nbsp;nationally. In turn, local United Way chapters use their intimate community knowledge to connect social service organizations with DoorDash for deliveries. Barbara and her box trucks are another example of partnerships. In these trying times, partnerships are paramount; when we get out of this mess, keep them going in our future food system.</p>
              <p><strong>COMMUNICATE&nbsp;</strong>// Attendee Neal Bram, CEO of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=fdd2699c3d&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">Project Waste Not</a>, highlighted the need to open communications to find where food supply and demand have shifted in this crisis. For Project Waste Not, this entails pulling suppliers' food availability data and sharing it with buyers who can then purchase food instead of letting it go to waste.</p>
              <p><strong>"SNOWBALL"&nbsp;</strong>// If you need something or have an idea, Barbara recommends starting with one outreach, like a call or Facebook post, then asking respondents who else they recommend you contact. Do the same with those contacts. As you roll along this way, you will &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; and pick up more people to help you find or share what you intend.</p>
              <p><strong>KEEP MOVING&nbsp;</strong>// Melissa Spiesman, Vice President and National Site Director at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=e02e77b4eb&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">Food Rescue US</a>, reminded us that the best way to prevent logistics disruptions is to keep supply chains intact where possible. Food Rescue US is doing so by forming community kitchens in corporate dining facilities; this keeps kitchens open, food flowing, and bellies full.</p>
              <p><strong>GET CREATIVE&nbsp;</strong>// Never-before-seen challenges demand never-before-seen solutions born of creativity. Many of the above best practices didn&rsquo;t exist before this pandemic. But people used creativity to find solutions where before there were none. Tim was helping us get creative on the call, wondering whether liquor stores (open in his home state of California) could become retailers of surplus fresh produce, too.</p>

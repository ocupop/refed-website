              <h5 id="takeaways">------<strong><br />KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM EACH DISCUSSION</strong></h5>
              <p><strong>April 15 - LOGISTICS:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><em></em><strong>USE IDLE ASSETS</strong><em> </em>// Many organizations have stopped operations by choice or by law; that could mean they have idle assets like trucks, refrigerators, and kitchens available for use. Think about what you need and think outside the box about who may have it. Barbara, for example, is using idle trucks and drivers from a party tent rental company and municipalities.</li>
                <li><strong>SIMPLIFY<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>// Our work in these chaotic times can be made easier by simplifying what we do. SKU rationalization &mdash; reducing the number of products you carry &mdash; is a great place to start. Tim also highlighted that simplified rules, from produce specifications to federal regulations, have already helped turn food surpluses into viable supplies.</li>
                <li><strong></strong><strong>FIND NEW CHANNELS</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>// With the unpredictable supply and demand of food, new channels have proven to be successful in preventing food from being wasted. Convenience stores now carry fresh produce items; broadliners are supplying retailers; restaurants are selling fresh produce, meat, and essentials like TP directly to consumers; and foodservice companies are working with food recovery organizations to break up large pallets of food and distribute it.&nbsp;</li>
                <li><strong></strong><strong>PARTNER</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>// Sueli highlighted the importance of partnerships. DoorDash and United Way have&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=76de6fbe60&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">partnered</a>&nbsp;nationally. In turn, local United Way chapters use their intimate community knowledge to connect social service organizations with DoorDash for deliveries. Barbara and her box trucks are another example of partnerships. In these trying times, partnerships are paramount; when we get out of this mess, keep them going in our future food system.</li>
                <li><em></em><strong>COMMUNICATE</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>// Attendee Neal Bram, CEO of&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=fdd2699c3d&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">Project Waste Not</a>, highlighted the need to open communications to find where food supply and demand have shifted in this crisis. For Project Waste Not, this entails pulling suppliers' food availability data and sharing it with buyers who can then purchase food instead of letting it go to waste.</li>
                <li><strong></strong><strong>"SNOWBALL"</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>// If you need something or have an idea, Barbara recommends starting with one outreach, like a call or Facebook post, then asking respondents who else they recommend you contact. Do the same with those contacts. As you roll along this way, you will &ldquo;snowball&rdquo; and pick up more people to help you find or share what you intend.</li>
                <li><em></em><strong>KEEP MOVING</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>// Melissa Spiesman, Vice President and National Site Director at&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=e02e77b4eb&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">Food Rescue US</a>, reminded us that the best way to prevent logistics disruptions is to keep supply chains intact where possible. Food Rescue US is doing so by forming community kitchens in corporate dining facilities; this keeps kitchens open, food flowing, and bellies full.</li>
                <li><strong></strong><strong>GET CREATIVE</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>// Never-before-seen challenges demand never-before-seen solutions born of creativity. Many of the above best practices didn&rsquo;t exist before this pandemic. But people used creativity to find solutions where before there were none. Tim was helping us get creative on the call, wondering whether liquor stores (open in his home state of California) could become retailers of surplus fresh produce, too.</li>
              </ul>
              <p id="takeaways-april-22"><strong>APRIL 22 - LABOR:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>CARE FOR EACH OTHER&nbsp;</strong>// Melissa, Denise, and Katherine each repeatedly reminded us of the importance of taking care of each other. We have to stay well now if we&rsquo;re to rebound strong when the world opens back up. This includes adopting the physical cleanliness and safety&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=5301e38263&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">measures</a>&nbsp;the CDC recommends, but also goes further. Denise highlighted how Kroger is providing additional time off and shortening store hours to facilitate recuperation, as well as boosting morale with positive reinforcement like recognitions and &ldquo;hero&rdquo; bonuses. This is a marathon, not a sprint, after all (though it probably feels like both).</li>
                <li><strong>CREATE CONTINUITY&nbsp;</strong>// This is a best practice from last week worth repeating: the best way to prevent labor disruptions is to keep operations going. On last week&rsquo;s installment, Melissa called in as a guest to share that Food Rescue US is doing this by forming community kitchens in corporate dining facilities; this keeps kitchens open, labor in place, and food flowing. This week, Katherine added that a recent James Beard Foundation (JBF) survey showed 30% of their members are continuing operations by feeding hospital workers, supplying school food centers, or feeding restaurant workers in need.</li>
                <li><strong>SEEK &amp; SHARE KNOWLEDGE&nbsp;</strong>// Denise and Katherine highlighted how their organizations are learning from our collective experience and sharing it with others &mdash; Kroger through their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=a2d6d108bb&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">Blueprint for Businesses</a>, and JBF through their&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=40ac8bd55d&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">industry support webinars</a>. In this way, we can improve collectively and keep more of our labor force intact.</li>
                <li><strong>DIVERSIFY LABOR&nbsp;</strong>// COVID-19 has underscored the huge role that more senior volunteers play in the charitable food system. Given the heightened risks to this population, they cannot safely support the food insecure as they once did. This requires younger age groups to fill in and is creating a more inclusive charitable food system.</li>
                <li><strong>STREAMLINE&nbsp;</strong>// Food Rescue US has always streamlined by recruiting online and onboarding through simple conversations. This helps get labor in place quickly (in as little as 30 minutes) and with the proper personal protective equipment (PPE). Likewise, Kroger expedited their hiring process to bring on more than 60,000 new employees and meet the surge in grocery demand.</li>
                <li><strong>PROMOTE POLICY&nbsp;</strong>// Katherine highlighted the policy work she and JBF are doing to expand unemployment benefits, SNAP access, farmer support, and stabilization for the small business community. She reminded us that we can all advocate for these policies by sharing information like JBF&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=6de17371b5&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">social media</a>&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://refed.us11.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5e060ada59945afadbd7234ce&amp;id=989251eb55&amp;e=7cffe9e0e2">posts</a>. Such efforts will be important to taking care of each other so we can rebound quickly when the time comes.</li>
                <li><strong>DIVERSIFY REVENUES&nbsp;</strong>// Employees, of course, require compensation. Katherine highlighted how restaurants are able to keep paying employees by creating new revenue streams. They&rsquo;re doing so by, for example, selling wine and cocktails to go, as well as converting to grocery stores.</li>
                <li><strong>CONNECT WITH COMMUNITIES</strong>&nbsp;// Melissa highlighted the importance of working with communities to understand their nuanced strengths and needs. Likewise, Kroger has connected with communities hardest hit by the pandemic &mdash; like the bars and restaurants supported by JBF &mdash; to build a labor pipeline.</li>

              <ul>
                <li><strong>PREVENT PERSON-TO-PERSON TRANSMISSION //&nbsp; </strong>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have examples of food or food packaging leading to [COVID-19],&rdquo; shared Ben. Our focus should therefore be on preventing person-to-person transmission. For that, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">CDC-recommended</a> hand washing, social distancing, cloth face coverings and mask wearing, cough and sneeze catching, and cleaning and disinfecting are still best.</li>
                <li><strong>LABELING // </strong>Ben stressed the importance of allergen and temperature labeling, even as FDA has rightly relaxed labeling regulations to keep food moving through the chain. Tracy highlighted that she and <a href="https://offtheirplate.org/"><em>Off Their Plate</em></a> place allergen information on every meal they make for healthcare workers. As for temperature labels, it remains vital to include thawing instructions, storage temperatures, and safe minimum internal temperatures.</li>
                <li><strong>USE YOUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPT. // </strong>Kevin emphasized the helpfulness of local health departments. As organizations shift to new, unfamiliar ways of working in response to COVID-19, these departments can help ensure food stays safe for consumption. Find yours <a href="https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory">here</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>SCRUTINIZE SELF-SERVE // </strong>As society reopens, Ben predicts we&rsquo;ll need to rethink self-serve options, from buffets to pump condiments and even salt shakers on tables. While some self-serve options may go away altogether, disinfecting them between uses will be required at least.</li>
                <li><strong>STANDARDIZE //</strong> As Tracy and <a href="https://offtheirplate.org/"><em>Off Their Plate</em></a> ramped up, she couldn&rsquo;t find standard operating procedures (SOP) for this new type of operation confronting a pandemic. She therefore created her own in partnership with local safety experts. Standardizing safe operations engrains good habits in an organization and makes sharing them easier.</li>
                <li><strong>BE INCLUSIVE // </strong>The ways we learn and the languages we speak are as diverse as the foods we eat. It&rsquo;s therefore important to be inclusive of all learning styles and languages when developing safety materials. For example, Tracy&rsquo;s SOPs come in multiple languages and, for visual learners, Tracy plans to include videos and infographics.</li>
                <li><strong>CLEAN CARS // </strong>The volunteer delivery vehicles for <a href="https://offtheirplate.org/"><em>Off Their Plate</em></a><em> </em>are regularly inspected and held to a cleanliness standard. Better yet, Tracy has found and started using commercial vehicles (from a florist) that are designed for easy deep-cleaning each day.</li>
                <li><strong>SPACE OUT //</strong> Keeping social distance can be hard, especially in small kitchens. Tracy sets up her kitchen with prep spaces over six feet apart, limits the number of people in her kitchen, and cooks primarily out of ovens (so people aren&rsquo;t nearby at the stove). She&rsquo;s also implemented &ldquo;one way streets&rdquo; in the kitchen so people never flow within six feet of each other.</li>
                <li><strong>PLAN TO NOT WASTE </strong>// &ldquo;Nothing we&rsquo;re recommending for safety should increase food waste,&rdquo; said Ben. Su-Lin recommends food organizations put a plan in place to account for food waste, such as identifying food recovery organizations in your area that could take your surplus food. At the same time, Tracy thinks her restaurant is wasting less food than ever because they are planning meals for deliveries days in advance.</li>
                <li><strong>CONTACTLESS DELIVERY // </strong>To maintain social distance, contactless delivery is a must. When doing home deliveries, Su-Lin and Replate leave food at their customer&rsquo;s doorstep, knock, and return to their vehicles. They collect every customer&rsquo;s contact info, so if nobody answers their knock, they can communicate with them over the phone from a distance. Likewise, when <em>Off Their Plate </em>delivers to hospitals, hospital coordinators take food out of the vehicle without interacting with the deliverer. All payments are handled electronically and personal protective equipment (PPE) is worn.</li>

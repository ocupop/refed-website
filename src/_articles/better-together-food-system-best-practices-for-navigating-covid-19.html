              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how food waste solution providers and food businesses must operate to safely do their work. What are the new challenges they&rsquo;re facing? What can they be doing to overcome them? And what can they learn from others who are successfully adapting their operations to this new reality?</p>
              <p>To help answer these questions and more, ReFED is launching a weekly discussion series: <strong><em>Better Together: Food System Best Practices for Navigating COVID-19</em></strong><em>. </em>Each installment will focus on a specific food system challenge. We&rsquo;ll start each discussion by hearing from guest panelists who have found encouraging solutions to the challenge and/or have expertise in the area. From there, we&rsquo;ll open the floor and welcome you to share your learnings, activities, and questions.</p>
              <p>Join us <strong>every Wednesday at 3:00PM Eastern / 12:00PM Pacific starting on April 15</strong> by registering through the links below. Not sure you&rsquo;ll be able to attend? Register anyway to receive updates and recordings of each installment.</p>

On October 24 and ahead of the release of the [2018 U.S. Food Waste Investment Report](https://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED-2018-US-Food-Waste-Investment-Report.pdf){: target="_blank"}, six disruptive circular economy of food innovators shared with a packed room of more than 150 investors, foundations, corporates, and entrepreneurs how they turn wasted food into business profits, hunger relief, and environmental stewardship at ReFED’s first-ever Innovation Demo Day at [SOCAP](https://socialcapitalmarkets.net/){: target="_blank"}.

[Goodr](https://goodr.co/){: target="_blank"}, an Atlanta-based startup using blockchain technology to recover surplus food from corporations, won first place; awarded one of the coveted spots at ReFED’s next [Innovator Workshop and U.S. Food Waste Summit](https://www.refed.com/content-hub/great-minds-think-differently-diverse-group-at-innovator-workshop-accelerates-food-waste-solutions){: target="_blank"}. The Runner Up was [Pulp Pantry](https://pulppantry.com/){: target="_blank"}, an LA-based CPG company transforming forgotten, nutrient-rich ingredients into delicious, healthy snacks.

### **Why Food Waste?**

Solving the challenge of food waste is a means to multiple ends and completely achievable given coordination and collaboration between food businesses, funders, solution providers, and policymakers.

In the U.S., we spend over $218 billion each year growing, processing, transporting, and disposing of food that is never eaten. ReFED’s [Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste](https://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf){: target="_blank"} estimates that an $18 billion investment from a combination of public, private, and philanthropic capital sources into 27 cost-effective, scalable solutions could generate more than $100 billion of economic value while reducing U.S. food waste by 20 percent.

To that end and as detailed in the [2018 U.S. Food Waste Investment Report](https://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED-2018-US-Food-Waste-Investment-Report.pdf){: target="_blank"}, ReFED is seeing multiple signs of positive momentum as new market-based innovations continue to emerge and begin to scale and as a full spectrum of interconnected capital types is being deployed.

In an effort to bring awareness to this exciting momentum, ReFED designed and executed the Demo Day with the help of key innovator and investor stakeholders.

### **Food Waste Is A Shared Challenge And Shared Opportunity**

Thanks to the innovators’ first-hand knowledge and judges’ insightful questions, attendees gained a clearer understanding of the tremendous business opportunity in capturing and repurposing food that might otherwise be discarded in landfills.

The pitches also demonstrated the complementary benefits that arise when these new innovations and technologies work together. For instance, the byproduct of juicing ugly produce can be transformed into healthy snacks. Edible, excess prepared food can be posted on a food recovery app and used to feed the hungry. And at the end of the supply chain, uneaten food can be used to create nutrient-dense hydroponic organic fertilizers.

There seems to be no limit to the impact that technology, innovation, and boots-on-the-ground hard work can have on transforming food waste into jobs, hunger relief, and sustainable business profits.

**The Huge Climate Opportunity of Wasting Less Food**

**September 12, 2018**

**Program**: 1-4:30pm, Koret Auditorium, 100 Larkin Street, San Francisco, CA

**Reception**: 5-7pm, War Memorial Green Room, 401 Van Ness Avenue, San Francisco, CA

The impacts of wasted food are truly jaw dropping—approximately one third of food around the world goes uneaten, giving it a larger carbon footprint than any country other than the U.S. and China. In fact, wasting less food is ranked the # 3 solution for carbon impact by Project Drawdown—higher than building solar farms or planting trees. Addressing wasted food also reduces pressure on land and water resources and creates opportunities to relieve food insecurity. This makes it a triple-win solution.

Action to reduce wasted food is exploding.

**This event will include:**

* An announcement by the Pacific Coast Collaborative, a group of Governors and Mayors from states and cities along the West Coast, about a new regional goal.

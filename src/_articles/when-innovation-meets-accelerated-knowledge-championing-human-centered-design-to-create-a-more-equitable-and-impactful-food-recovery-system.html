              <p>At <a href="https://www.refed.com/">ReFED</a>, we spend a lot of time pondering the various mechanisms we can utilize to improve the food system, reduce waste and ensure that food ultimately goes towards serving its highest purpose of feeding people in a dignified manner.</p>
              <p>Through the generous support of the <a target="_blank" href="https://walmart.org/">Walmart Foundation</a> and in partnership with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.plusacumen.org/">+Acumen</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refed.com/2019accelerator">ReFED Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator</a> was launched to accelerate the impact of food recovery solutions &mdash; value-added processing, donation transportation and coordination, donation matching software, gleaning and more &mdash; that redistribute nutritious and high quality food, that would otherwise go uneaten, to the people who need it most. The 2019 Accelerator cohort of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refed.com/content-hub/2019-accelerator-cohort-announcement/">10 innovative food recovery organizations</a> represents a diverse group of entrepreneurs in various stages of testing new business models and, with the shared mission of improving and expanding the current system of food recovery through cost-effective and scalable solutions.</p>
              <p>Essential to the success of this three month Accelerator program are the three in-person Learning Labs that bring to life a virtual curriculum and equip participants with a space to catalyze ideas, co-create solutions and share best practices. The first Learning Lab kicked off on September 10-11, 2019 at IDEO headquarters in San Francisco, CA with the purpose of:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Accelerating relationship-building and mentorships in order to drive trust, ideation, and insight sharing; and</li>
                <li>Shifting mindsets on the journey to designing a more sustainable, equitable, and dignified food system.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Designing an Efficient and Equitable Food System</h3>
              <p><img width="1781" height="818" src="/uploads/blog3image-2.jpg" /></p>
              <p>The two-day agenda centered around training the Accelerator cohort on the skills needed to utilize human-centered design and research to test the earned revenue models that they will be developing throughout the course of the program.</p>
              <p>Mapping out opportunities in the food recovery ecosystem highlighted the key stakeholders and valued assets most relevant to each business model, and Expert Network members helped identify the white spaces where new connections can be made. These customized conversations were initiated to provide tailored insights and feedback on each of the new food recovery models that cohort members aim to implement.</p>
              <h3>Food Recovery Organizations Are Asking Many of the Same Questions</h3>
              <p><img width="2000" height="1333" src="/uploads/blog4image-1.jpg" /></p>
              <p>The diverse group represented at the Learning Lab found common ground in the places where they find the greatest opportunity for growing earned revenue models and technology-enabled solutions.</p>
              <p>Themes of prime opportunity areas that emerged from the Ecosystems Mapping Workshop and will continue to be explored throughout the Accelerator program include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Shifting recovery mindsets from one of charity to one of service offerings</li>
                <li>Desire to work more closely with and gain support from Feeding America</li>
                <li>Need to find new types of donor segments such as commercial real estate and events as well as new outlets for rescued food beyond food banks; e.g. Imperfect Produce</li>
                <li>Potential for earned revenue in selling and sharing data, seeing insurers and healthcare providers as paying customers, white labeling and licensing, and freemium models</li>
                <li>Need to find new models to support recovery beyond the current reliance on volunteer labor</li>
                <li>Need for alignment of food recovery terminology (e.g. receiving agency versus food pantry versus recovery organization)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>After two days of building new connections, mapping what a future food recovery system might look like, and of course, many hundreds of sticky notes, the ReFED Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator members left fired up and ready to begin testing their new ideas.</p>
              <h3>Key Moments from the Learning Lab that Remind Us Why We're All Here:</h3>
              <p><img width="2000" height="1333" src="/uploads/blog5image-1.jpg" /></p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Voices From the Field:</strong> <strong>The</strong> <strong>Client Interview Workshop</strong> was a powerful opportunity for attendees to speak directly with users of food donation services to better understand how the current food donation system works and can be improved in order to increase the dignity and accessibility for the food insecure Americans that rely on these services on a daily basis.</li>
                <li>The<strong> Recology Field Trip</strong> to the municipal landfill gave us the opportunity to observe what happens at the end of the supply chain to food and other organic products. This landfill visit gave us a whiff of what food waste looks (and smells) like, and why it&rsquo;s crucial to prevent and recover surplus food upstream before it spoils</li>
                <li><strong>Getting a Taste of Surplus Food</strong>: Thanks to some serious local talent, we were able to put into practice food waste prevention and recovery solutions. <a target="_blank" href="http://foodshift.net/">Food Shift</a> catered our breakfast and lunch using recovered surplus produce, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.re-plate.org/">Replate</a> picked up all the leftovers to bring to a local nonprofit serving community members experiencing food insecurity. Food waste advocate and James Beard Award winning chef, Nick Balla, prepared an incredible rescued food dinner at Cookhouse, a secret dinner club in San Francisco.</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Bringing the Experts to the Table</h3>

              <p>The first Learning Lab would not have generated such positive and applicable learnings without representation from our impressive 50-member Accelerator Expert Network, who shared their technical knowledge and wisdom gained through their years of experience working in the food system. Some of the expert members in attendance include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Food businesses that span the food supply chain: <em>Blue Apron, Imperfect Foods, Taylor Farms, Tyson Foods</em></li>
                <li>Capital providers invested in accelerating food recovery solutions: <em>Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, Pisces Foundation, Rabobank</em></li>
                <li>Government agencies with a deep understanding of important food recovery policies like organic landfill bans and food safety regulations<em>: CalRecycle, Food and Drug Administration, Environmental Protection Agency</em></li>
                <li>Technology companies continuously improving the way food is sourced, tracked and delivered to the end user: <em>Afresh, Cisco, Door Dash, Spoiler Alert</em></li>
                <li>Supply chain and food systems experts with a unique understanding of how food moves from farms to retailers to consumers: <em>Food Donation Connection, Food For Soul, Food System 6</em></li>
              </ul>

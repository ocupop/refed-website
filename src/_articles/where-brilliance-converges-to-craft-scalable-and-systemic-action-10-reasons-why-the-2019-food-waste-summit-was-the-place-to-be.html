              <p>We have all heard it countless times before: <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodwaste/faqs">up to 40 percent of the food in the United States</a> is never eaten each year, yet <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/hunger-in-america">one in nine Americans</a> struggle to put enough food on their plates.</p>

Last month, a diverse group of 50 food waste innovators joined 30 food businesses, funders, and policymakers at an Innovator Workshop ahead of the [U.S. Food Waste Summit](https://www.chlpi.org/food-law-and-policy/major-events/u-s-food-waste-summit-2018/){: target="_blank"}. Co-hosted by [ReFED](refed.com), [Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic (FLPC)](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/clinical/clinics/food-law-and-policy-clinic-of-the-center-for-health-law-and-policy-innovation/?mc_cid=0ad8db9cfa&amp;mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D){: target="_blank"}, and the [Harvard Business School Business and Environment Initiative](https://www.hbs.edu/environment/Pages/default.aspx?mc_cid=0ad8db9cfa&amp;mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D){: target="_blank"}, the event convened leaders working to implement innovative solutions that turn wasted food into jobs, hunger relief, and environmental stewardship.

Realizing that food waste presents a relatively untapped $2 billion market opportunity, entrepreneurs, investors, and corporations are increasingly noticing the impact potential for changing the food waste status quo. The workshop provided a unique opportunity for exploration of emerging trends and barriers in the sector, enabling innovators, food businesses, investors, and foundations to discuss collaborative strategies for scaling their individual and collective impact.

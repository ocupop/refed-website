Last month, a diverse group of 50 food waste innovators joined 30 food businesses, funders, and policymakers at an Innovator Workshop ahead of the [U.S. Food Waste Summit](https://www.chlpi.org/food-law-and-policy/major-events/u-s-food-waste-summit-2018/){: target="_blank"}. Co-hosted by [ReFED](refed.com), [Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic (FLPC)](https://hls.harvard.edu/dept/clinical/clinics/food-law-and-policy-clinic-of-the-center-for-health-law-and-policy-innovation/?mc_cid=0ad8db9cfa&amp;mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D){: target="_blank"}, and the [Harvard Business School Business and Environment Initiative](https://www.hbs.edu/environment/Pages/default.aspx?mc_cid=0ad8db9cfa&amp;mc_eid=%5BUNIQID%5D){: target="_blank"}, the event convened leaders working to implement innovative solutions that turn wasted food into jobs, hunger relief, and environmental stewardship.

Realizing that food waste presents a relatively untapped $2 billion market opportunity, entrepreneurs, investors, and corporations are increasingly noticing the impact potential for changing the food waste status quo. The workshop provided a unique opportunity for exploration of emerging trends and barriers in the sector, enabling innovators, food businesses, investors, and foundations to discuss collaborative strategies for scaling their individual and collective impact.

Our key takeaways:

### The Power of Convening Is Alive and Well

There’s significant value in bringing together the many players in the food waste space. The workshop afforded innovators the opportunity to share best practices, identify complementary initiatives, and forge partnerships to maximize impact. One Berkeley-based innovator shared that he’d never had such meaningful conversations with so many individuals at a single conference.

This workshop also demonstrated that curated connections multiply collective impact. Group discussions are valuable, but hand-selected pairings can accelerate specific projects and partnerships. This was exemplified during the workshop’s “speed-dating” session, when ReFED matched innovators with funders and food businesses to pitch their solutions and receive detailed advice.

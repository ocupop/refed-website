              <p>Established in 1995 by founder and CEO, Bruce Taylor, Taylor Farms is an American-based producer of 180 million weekly servings of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. Nicole Flewell has spent the past decade at Taylor Farms in various roles ranging from administration to business intelligence. In her current capacity as Director of Sustainability, she oversees and implements Taylor Farm&rsquo;s sustainability initiatives at their 17 facilities across North America. Nicole shares that the company&rsquo;s motivation to fight food waste is centered on the desire to not only reduce surplus food generation but to maximize efficiency and get the highest yield out of the field and in the plant.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>With the great local partnerships that Taylor Farms has fostered with food banks and food recovery organizations, Nicole sees opportunities for more quality excess food at the plant level to be diverted from farms to feed the hungry. From her experience developing fresh, healthy prepared meals for a mass market it is vital for non-profit organizations to understand the supply chain from field to fork and be attuned to the cultural differences in the types of produce people in low-income households consume.</p>

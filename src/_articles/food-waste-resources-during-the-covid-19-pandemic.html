              <p>While our number one concern is for the health of those affected by COVID-19, ReFED also recognizes that our collective response to this crisis - such as buying food in bulk to guard against potential disruptions in supply chains; the forced closures of schools, restaurants, and other organizations that serve food; and more - is increasing the amount of food waste. And in many cases, the food being wasted could have gone to the most vulnerable among us through recovery and distribution programs.</p>
              <p>That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re working with our partners to highlight those organizations that can help ensure that excess food gets to the people who need it most. We&rsquo;ll continue to update this list as we become aware of more resources. Please send us suggested organizations to include at <a href="mailto:info@refed.com">info@refed.com</a>.</p>
              <p>We've also compiled a list of organizations that need financial and operational support right now in our <em>Directory of Fundable Initiatives</em>. You can access it <a href="/content-hub/directory-of-fundable-initiatives/">here</a>.</p>

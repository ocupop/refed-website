              <p><strong>San Francisco, CA </strong>(September 4, 2019) &mdash; Today, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refed.com/?sort=economic-value-per-ton">ReFED</a>, the only U.S. nonprofit wholly dedicated to reducing food waste, announced the cohort of ten organizations that will participate in its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.refed.com/2019accelerator">Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator</a>. Thanks to the generous support of the Walmart Foundation, in partnership with +Acumen and in collaboration with a world-class, 50-member Expert Network, the Accelerator aims to catalyze ideas and inspire actions that lead to a doubling of healthy food available to the 40 million Americans facing food insecurity.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;The Accelerator&rsquo;s nationwide Open Call for Applications confirmed ReFED&rsquo;s hypothesis that this type of program will provide value in the form of helping food recovery organizations overcome some of the biggest barriers to increasing the amount of nutritious food they can deliver in a dignified manner,&rdquo; explains <strong>Alexandria Coari, Director of Capital and Innovation at ReFED</strong>. &ldquo;Some of these barriers include funding models dependent on grants versus earned revenue, a reliance on volunteers instead of paid staff, underutilization of technology solutions, and a lack of collaboration and best practice sharing across the sector. These are just a few of the topics we&rsquo;ll tackle throughout the Accelerator.&rdquo; The Accelerator&rsquo;s one-of-a-kind, highly customized curriculum will combine a virtual classroom with in-person ReFED Learning Labs that focus on co-creating earned revenue models and technology-enabled solutions using human-centered design.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>More than 125 candidates applied for the Accelerator. The selected cohort range from long-standing food recovery organizations with hundreds of employees servicing thousands of donors, to newly formed innovative organizations that leverage concepts from the sharing economy and apply them to food rescue. What unites them is the desire to work together on a shared mission &mdash; to become operationally sustainable and deliver more impact at scale in a dignified and convenient way.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>&ldquo;Growing awareness about the scale of senseless food waste in this country has catalyzed existing organizations to innovate their paradigms and inspired energetic entrepreneurs to launch creative new models that use this surplus food as a resource,&rdquo; notes <strong>Emily Broad Leib, Assistant Clinical Professor of Law and Director of the Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic.</strong> &ldquo;As an Expert Network member, it has been incredible to see the response to ReFED&rsquo;s Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator, which will build the needed network and resources for these innovators. I am excited about the announcement of the 2019 cohort, and cannot wait to see them take the next steps to address this major societal issue of our era.&rdquo;</p>

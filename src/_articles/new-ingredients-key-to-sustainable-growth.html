<p>Recovered food is the primary source of meals provided by hunger relief organizations. In 2018, <a
    href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20Feeding%20America%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf">81%
    of Feeding America’s donations were recovered meals</a>, yet this represents only ~5% of the <a
    href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20Feeding%20America%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf">37
    million tons of unsold food inventory</a> generated within the food value chain each year.</p>

<p>Historically, recovery efforts have been led by highly localized nonprofit organizations (<a
    href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20Feeding%20America%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf">86%
    of US recovery organizations are nonprofits and 75% are local in reach</a>) that are dependent on philanthropic
  funding, physical infrastructure and volunteer labor. While this model has been successful in feeding many of the food
  insecure on a local basis, it has proven challenging to scale nationally, or even regionally.</p>

<p>With nearly 40 million Americans facing food insecurity, there is an enormous need and opportunity for recovery
  organizations to deliver more food at scale and become operationally sustainable. Developing earned revenue models and
  adopting innovative technology solutions are key to solving this problem. From its work tracking the latest food
  recovery trends and insights, ReFED has identified several examples of these efforts already underway.</p>

<p><strong>Innovative Uses of Earned Revenue Models and Technology</strong></p>

<p><em>Fee-For-Service Donation Platform and Driver Partnership with DoorDash at <a
      href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20Feeding%20America%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf">Replate</a></em>
</p>

<img src="/uploads/Replate.png" alt="Replate" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

<p>Replate, a Berkeley, California-based innovator, has technology that breaks the mold of a traditional recovery
  organization by utilizing strategies from the sharing economy to fight hunger. Using a fee-for-service revenue model,
  its web-based platform enables businesses such as Yelp, Facebook and LinkedIn to schedule on-demand pickups for
  surplus food.</p>

<p>Rather than relying on a volunteer-based transportation workforce, which can lead to challenges with consistency and
  reliability, Replate pays its drivers. The organization also has a partnership with DoorDash via Project DASH to
  leverage DoorDash’s logistics platform and Dasher (driver) network to supplement food deliveries. Since the launch of
  Project DASH in 2018, other recovery innovators such as Copia, Transfernation, Urban Gleaners, and 412 Food Rescue
  have also formed partnerships with DoorDash.</p>

<p>Replate also allows its donors to claim charitable tax deductions, and the web-based platform helps calculate the
  financial savings of donations. By providing a quality service many are willing to pay for, Replate demonstrates how
  technology-enabled solutions can recover more fresh, healthy and prepared food.</p>

<p><em>Dignified Recovered Food Retail at <a
      href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2018-12/2018%20Feeding%20America%20Annual%20Report_0.pdf">Daily
      Table</a></em></p>

<img src="/uploads/DailyTable.png" alt="Daily Table" style="padding-bottom:30px;">


<p>Daily Table, an innovative nonprofit retailer with two locations in the Greater Boston area, offers fresh produce,
  packaged items and prepared meals at affordable prices to all customers who sign up for a free membership. Recovering
  food that would otherwise be wasted, Daily Table sells healthy food at discounted prices which are competitive with
  fast-food restaurants. This unique business model provides clients with the dignity of buying affordable, high-quality
  food combined with the flexibility to make purchasing decisions based on individual food preferences. The
  organization’s recovery strategy fights hunger while reducing reliance on philanthropic funding.</p>

<p><em>Community Supported Agriculture Program and New Product Creation at <a href="https://412foodrescue.org/">412 Food
      Rescue</a></em></p>

<img src="/uploads/412FoodRescue.png" alt="412 Food
      Rescue" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

<p>412 Food Rescue, a Pittsburgh, PA-based recovery organization, utilizes an original app, “Food Rescue Hero,” to alert
  volunteers of available food, then coordinates pickups and transportation. 412 Food Rescue licenses the app-based
  technology platform and has a fee-for-service model which simultaneously increases broader food recovery capacity and
  provides earned revenue to operations.</p>

<p>The organization also earns revenue through other innovative business efforts to support operational costs. 412 Food
  Rescue offers a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) that provides customers with a box of “ugly” produce, creating
  new markets for previously unsellable produce from a local cooperative farm, and partners with local food and drink
  manufacturers to create new products like craft beer from surplus bread or ice cream from gleaned mulberries. A
  portion of product sales goes back to 412 Food Rescue as a source of earned revenue that supports continued food
  recovery and gleaning efforts. These product collaborations not only support 412 Food Rescue’s fundraising, they also
  introduce a new strategy for increasing food waste awareness among a larger customer base.</p>

<p><em>Value-Added Processing and Shared Community Kitchen Services at <a
      href="http://www.commonwealthkitchen.org/">CommonWealth Kitchen</a></em></p>

<img src="/uploads/CommonWealthKitchen.png" alt="CommonWealth Kitchen" style="padding-bottom:30px;">

<p>CommonWealth Kitchen, a Dorchester, MA-based innovator, offers shared kitchens and business development assistance to
  help aspiring entrepreneurs build new food companies. As one of the leading food business incubators and urban food
  manufacturing hubs in New England, CommonWealth Kitchen earns revenue by renting space in its warehouse and kitchen,
  offering classes and workshops, and executing value-added processing contracts for farms and wholesalers. Using this
  model, over 60 tons of surplus produce was processed in 2018. After tripling in size in just 10 years, CommonWealth
  Kitchen plans to continue to scale operations and the amount of recovered food it upcycles as they find new retail and
  wholesale markets and grow their institutional food service program.</p>

<p><strong>ReFED’s Vision for the Future of Food Recovery </strong></p>

<p>ReFED estimates that the food recovery sector has the potential to double the number of meals rescued annually. While
  many nonprofit innovators are implementing the strategies outlined above for expanding operations and delivering more
  food to those in need, realizing the opportunity will also require the following systems-level changes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Food donors should pay for the valuable services provided to them by nonprofit recovery organizations.</strong><br />
    <span style="font-weight: 300">Donors currently receive value in the form of tax savings, reductions to waste management costs, social and
    environmental benefits, stronger ties to their community and improved brand image. Paying something for these
    benefits would strengthen the entire food recovery ecosystem.</span></li>
  <li><strong>Food donation tax incentives should be expanded.</strong><br /><span style="font-weight: 300">ReFED estimates that expanding federal tax
    benefits to businesses and organizations that make donations via distribution strategies not currently covered under
    the current Good Samaritan Act would <a href="https://www.refed.com/downloads/Recovery_Solutions.pdf">create $470
      million annually in economic value and lead to the recovery of an additional 638 million meals</a>. State and
    federal policymakers should consider implementing these <a
      href="http://www.chlpi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/recommendations-bill-emerson-good-samaritan-act-fs.pdf">concrete
      policy recommendations</a>.</span></li>

  <li><strong>Food recovery legislation should support partnerships between food retailers and nonprofit food recovery
      organizations, where both would receive a percentage of the financial benefits created from donation tax
      incentives.</strong><br /><span style="font-weight: 300">
    Food recovery requires expenses and sharing a proportion of the donation tax incentive would contribute to the
    transportation, equipment and employment costs essential for maintaining and scaling an efficient food recovery
    operation.</span></li>
</ol>

              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Eric Davis, VP of Retail Product Sourcing, and Justin Block, Managing Director of MealConnect, about their roles supporting Feeding America's nationwide network of 200 member food banks and engaging people across the country in the fight to end hunger.</p>
              <p>Feeding America's network of 200 food banks and 60,000 agencies recover over 3 billion pounds of donated food a year. To increase the number of meals that can be recovered, including donations of smaller sizes and food with short shelf life, Feeding America created MealConnect, an app which makes it easier to connect food donors to their local Feeding America-member food banks. This technology platform allows member food banks to manage all of the connections between donors and agencies, and serves as an easy way to log all pickup and delivery information in one database.</p>
              <p>Eric and Justin see existing opportunities to make small donation pickups more cost-effective, and the need for greater innovation regarding last-mile delivery logistics. They discuss their vision for removing barriers for food donation so that the volume and velocity of donated food running through their network can continue to grow.</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen spoke to Eric and Justin to hear the lessons they've gleaned from their 25 years of combined experience in the food sector, and to gain a better understanding about the opportunities they see for continued partnership and innovation.</p>

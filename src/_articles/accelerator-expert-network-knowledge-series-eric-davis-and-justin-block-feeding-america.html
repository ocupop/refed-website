              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Eric Davis, VP of Retail Product Sourcing, and Justin Block, Managing Director of MealConnect, about their roles supporting Feeding America's nationwide network of 200 member food banks and engaging people across the country in the fight to end hunger.</p>
              <p>Feeding America's network of food banks and agencies recover over 3 billion pounds of donated food a year. To increase the number of meals that can be recovered, including donations of smaller sizes and food with shorter shelf lives, Feeding America created MealConnect, an app which makes it easier to connect food donors to their local Feeding America-member food banks. This technology platform allows member food banks to manage all of the connections between grocery stores and their agencies, and serves as an easy way to log all of the pickup and delivery information in one database.</p>
              <p>Eric and Justin identified the need for making small donation pickups more cost-effective, and called for greater innovation at the last mile of getting food to the client. They discuss their vision for removing barriers for food donation so that the volume and velocity of donated food running through their network can continue to grow.</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen from ReFED spoke to Eric and Justin to hear about the lessons learned from their 25 years combined experience in the food recovery sector, and to gain a better understanding about the opportunities they see for continued innovation and partnership.</p>

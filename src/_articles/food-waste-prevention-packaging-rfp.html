ReFED is seeking a seasoned packaging professional to develop a multistakeholder project plan for food waste prevention packaging. Contracted work includes but is not limited to:&nbsp;

* <u>Consider</u>&nbsp;current landscape and literature to inform the design of the initiative and identify key stakeholders
* <u>Identify, analyze, and prioritize</u>&nbsp;packaging solutions with high-volume and/or high-value food waste diversion potential. Final analysis should include the following:
  * Existing solutions in s**poilage prevention packaging, packaging adjustments, and compostable packaging**
  * Recommended food product categories and partners for implementation
  * Feasibility assessment of proposed solutions - current barrier(s) to adoption and recommended action to overcome barrier(s)
  * Ranking of solutions in terms of size of the opportunity (diversion potential, economic value, water conservation, GHG emissions reduction), and feasibility
* <u>Classify</u>&nbsp;recommended solutions as ready-to-scale, ready-to-pilot, and need further research or technical validation
* <u>Coordinate</u>&nbsp;with ReFED’s Multistakeholder Initiatives Director and Business Engagement Manager to ensure application in a ReFED working group context

Recommendations must also address sustainability trade-offs, particularly the challenge between packaging reduction and food waste prevention.

The final deliverable includes a packaging solutions Excel data set and a PowerPoint deck recommending the (1)&nbsp;**top three**&nbsp;packaging solutions that are proven, cost effective and scalable, (2)&nbsp;**top three**&nbsp;packaging solutions ready to pilot, and (3)&nbsp;**top three**&nbsp;packaging solutions requiring additional research or innovation. Each solution should include barriers and key stakeholders, as well as recommendations for next steps. &nbsp;<br><br>*Please read the [complete RFP](/ReFED RFP - Food Waste Prevention Packaging.pdf) for additional details.*

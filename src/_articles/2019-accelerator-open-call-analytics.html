              <p>In June 2019, ReFED launched an Open Call for Applications to the Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator, a three-month program designed to help food recovery organizations build capacity and become operationally sustainable. The Accelerator's one-of-a-kind, highly customized curriculum will combine a virtual classroom with in-person ReFED Learning Labs that focus on co-creating earned revenue models and technology-enabled solutions using human centered-design.&nbsp;</p>

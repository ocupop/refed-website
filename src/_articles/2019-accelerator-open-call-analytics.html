              <p>In June 2019, ReFED launched an Open Call for Applications to the Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator, a three-month program that aims to catalyze ideas and inspire actions that lead to a doubling of healthy food available to the 40 million Americans facing food insecurity. The Accelerator's one-of-a-kind, highly customized curriculum will combine a virtual classroom with in-person ReFED Learning Labs that focus on giving nonprofit innovators the tools they need to co-create earned revenue models and technology-enabled solutions using human centered-design.</p>

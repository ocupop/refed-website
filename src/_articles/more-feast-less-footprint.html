  <p><strong>Date</strong><br>September 12, 2018</p>
  <p><strong>Program</strong><br>1:00-4:00 pm<br>San Francisco Public Library (Koret Auditorium)<br>100 Larkin Street<br>San Francisco, CA 94102</p>
  <p><strong>Reception</strong><br>4:30-6:30 pm<br>War Memorial Green Room<br>401 Van Ness Avenue<br>San Francisco, CA 94102</p>
  <p>Join Project Drawdown, mayors from across the West Coast and Milan, and leaders from CalRecycle, World Bank, Sodexo, and more to learn more about the huge climate opportunity of wasting less food.</p>
  <p>The impacts of wasted food are truly jaw dropping—approximately one third of food around the world goes uneaten. Because of its huge climate footprint, wasting less food is ranked the # 3 solution for carbon impact by Project Drawdown—higher than building solar farms or planting trees. Addressing wasted food also reduces pressure on land and water resources and creates opportunities to relieve food insecurity. It is a global problem that touches everyone, and solutions can help to address environmental, hunger, and climate change challenges.</p>
  <p>Actions to reduce wasted food are garnering rapid uptake both nationally and internationally. Learn about new goals and the latest progress in both government and the private sector.</p>
  <p>Hosted by ReFED, NRDC, WWF, and the Pacific Coast Collaborative, this event will include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>An announcement by the Pacific Coast Collaborative, a partnership between Governors, Premier and Mayors from states, province and cities along the West Coast, about a new regional goal aimed at reducing wasted food by 2030.</li>
  <li>A showcase of solutions that are working in local government, industry, and financing.</li>

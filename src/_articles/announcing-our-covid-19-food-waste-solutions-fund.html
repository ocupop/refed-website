              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has completely disrupted the food supply chain, resulting in a surge of on-farm food loss, food business closures, and a growing number of food insecure individuals. In response to these new challenges, ReFED is launching our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/ReFEDCOVID-19FoodWasteSolutionsFund"><strong>COVID-19 Food Waste Solutions Fund</strong></a> to quickly deliver vital funding to organizations that can rapidly scale food waste reduction and hunger relief efforts.</p>
              <p>ReFED&rsquo;s COVID-19 Food Waste Solutions Fund is a streamlined, one-stop, rapid response vehicle delivering critical support to this important group of high-impact food waste organizations.ReFED will ensure 100 percent of what is donated will go directly to well-vetted food waste solution providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
              <p>We anticipate making a minimum of $1 million worth of grants over the next 30 days. Our aim is to continue raising up to $10 million of donations that will be quickly regranted by ReFED to organizations in a position to make a major impact over the next few months.</p>

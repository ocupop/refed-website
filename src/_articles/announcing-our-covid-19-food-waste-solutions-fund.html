              <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has completely disrupted the food supply chain, resulting in a surge of on-farm food loss, food business closures, and a growing number of food insecure individuals. In response to these new challenges, we have launched the <strong>ReFED</strong>&nbsp;<strong>COVID-19 Food Waste Solutions Fund</strong> to quickly deliver vital funding to organizations that can rapidly scale food waste reduction and hunger relief efforts.</p>
              <p>The ReFED COVID-19 Food Waste Solutions Fund is a streamlined, one-stop, rapid response vehicle delivering critical support to this important group of high-impact food waste organizations. 100 percent of what is donated will go directly to well-vetted food waste solution providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
              <p>We anticipate making a minimum of $1 million of grants over the next 30 days to a portfolio of organizations that will be able to &ndash; in the next 90 days &ndash;drive impact of more<strong>&nbsp;</strong>than a total of 10 million pounds of food waste prevented or meals rescued. Our aim is to continue raising up to $10 million of donations that will be quickly regranted by ReFED to organizations in a position to make a major impact over the next few months.</p>

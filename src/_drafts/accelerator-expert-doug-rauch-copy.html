              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Bill Reighard, President and Founder of Food Donation Connection (FDC), who spent a long career with PepsiCo, overseeing Asia operations for retailers like Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. When the executive team at Pizza Hut told him about an idea for donating leftover prepared food to food recovery agencies, he was immediately intrigued. Bill tested this model with Pizza Hut and now, over 25 years later, FDC has coordinated the donation of over 550 million pounds of quality prepared food in 24 countries. Built on a business model that maximizes tax donation incentives and pays critical attention to food safety, FDC is planning to continue pursing business opportunities with new partners interested in establishing or improving upon their existing current food donation program.</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen (an Accelerator Program Partner) sat down with Bill to discuss how FDC continuously iterates and improves their food recovery business model, and to hear his advice for other organizations in the food recovery space.</p>

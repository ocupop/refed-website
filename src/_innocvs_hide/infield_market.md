description: The iNFIELD MARKET platform is a secure B2B Multi Storefront e Commerce
  site built to display product and connect buyers and sellers. We offer this service
  to qualified Food and Beverage, Nutraceutical and Animal Feed manufacturers and
  brands in possession of excess ingredient inventories to list and sell their excess
  materials. The online ingredient market is focused on increasing supply chain efficiency
  and reducing ingredient waste in manufacturing by displaying real time mapping &
  inventory and all of the information necessary to make an informed decision. Manufacturing
  ingredient waste in the landfill is at epidemic levels and commonly overlooked.
  We aim to create a sharing and efficient business culture.

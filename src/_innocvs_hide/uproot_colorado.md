  through gleaning, experiential education, research and legislative advocacy, with
  a vision to co-create a healthier, more connected, and just foodshed in Colorado
  by increasing healthy food access�and food equity�for Coloradans at or below poverty
  level, including the working poor, while also increasing the rate of nutritional
  security statewide. UpRoot works to measurably reduce on-farm surplus agriculture
  in Colorado with an endgame of cultivating a Colorado foodshed where every resident
  has access to healthy, nutrient-dense food, where hunger pangs are in the past,
  and where markets value farmers for what they are: a cornerstone of our society.'

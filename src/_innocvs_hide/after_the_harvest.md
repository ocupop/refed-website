description: After the Harvest rescues nutritious fruits and vegetables from going
  to waste and donates them to agencies that serve hungry people, primarily in Greater
  Kansas City. Our volunteers glean after the harvest, picking what's left in farmers'
  fields and picking up already harvested leftover produce. The majority of the funds
  we raise helps secure semi-truckloads of donated produce that might otherwise end
  up in landfills.

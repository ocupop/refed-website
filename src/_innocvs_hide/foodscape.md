description: foodSCAPE works with schools, students, parents and food service providers
  to reduce food waste by focusing on healthy choices for students, donating useable
  food to people in need, and diverting the rest of the food from the landfill to
  animal feed, composting, or energy production. foodSCAPE has worked with the RI
  Department of Health to develop guidelines for the safe recovery of nutritious food
  from school meals to be donated to organizations that care for people in need. We
  will be working with the Rhode Island Department of Education to distribute these
  guidelines and following up to help with technical assistance and education programs
  to support food rescue and food waste diversion.

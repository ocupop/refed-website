description: 'Grow Appalachia partners with community organizations throughout Central
  Appalachia to strengthen local food systems and economies on the household and commercial
  scale. Many of the partnering sites engage their communities in food recovery efforts,
  teach composting methods and food waste prevention best practices to family participants,
  and provide food preservation education as a means of building household food supply
  while minimizing prepackaged waste. Additionally, Grow Appalachia has worked with
  eight communities in central Appalachia to build multiuse kitchen facilities which
  provide space to manufacture value-added products, operate food recovery and gleaning
  initiatives, serve community meals, and teach cooking and preservation classes. '

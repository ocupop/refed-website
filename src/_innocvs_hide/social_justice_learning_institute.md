description: The Social Justice Learning Institute (SJLI) is dedicated to improving
  the education, health, and wellbeing of youth and communities of color by empowering
  them to enact social change through research, training, and community mobilization.
  SJLI's Food for Thought Produce Pickup event addresses health disparities and combats
  diet-related diseases by promoting increase in fruit and vegetable consumption,
  and encouraging families to incorporate more produce in their eating habits; the
  event occurs monthly with plans to expand to twice a month. SJLI partners with local
  nonprofit organization Food Forward and Inglewood Unified School District (IUSD)
  to execute this by recovering fresh produce from wholesale markets and distributing
  this produce to families at a local high school. Any produce not selected by the
  families is composted to replenish SJLI's 100 Seeds for Change network of community
  and school gardens. Through this program, SJLI creates a local closed-loop food
  system by offering healthy food to families, empowering individuals to make healthy
  choices, reducing food waste, and composting so that its community gardens can continue
  to provide more high quality produce to Inglewood residents.

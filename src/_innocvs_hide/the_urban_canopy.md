description: Our vision is to show how urban agriculture is part of creating a sustainable
  and equitable food system. Our indoor and outdoor farms within Chicago grow Wheatgrass
  and fresh produce, which is sold directly to consumers through farmers markets and
  our Community Supported Agriculture membership. Lastly, we complete the nutrient
  cycle through our Compost Club to collect food waste and compostables. The materials
  are composted in Chicago and help us create soil for our farm and others to grow
  even more fresh produce! :)

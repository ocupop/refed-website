description: Ecoverse represents the Tiger Depackaging System. The Tiger Depack helps
  divert organic waste from landfills and provides valuable nutrients to compost facilities
  and animal nutrition while also providing energy feedstock to renewable energy outlets
  such as anaerobic digestion. The Tiger Depack equipment maximizes revenue potential,
  production levels, compost quality, (renewable) energy potential, value of recyclables
  and regulatory compliance. The machine reduces organic contamination, energy consumption,
  overhead expenses, disposal fees, utility costs, down time and operational footprint.
  After the Tiger depackaging/separation process, organics are contaminant-free and
  the packaging material is well-suited for immediate re-purposing.

  label: What is Food Waste?
  title:
  summary: >-
    <p>Various organizations define food waste in different ways. ReFED has
    conducted our analysis using surplus food – defined as all food that goes
    unsold or unused by a business or that goes uneaten at home – including food
    and inedible parts (e.g., peels, pits, bones) that are donated, fed to
    animals, repurposed to produce other products, composted, or anaerobically
    digested. Because this includes donated food, we have subtracted these
    donations to generate our estimates of uneaten food. We use the term food
    waste as a subset of uneaten food to describe food that goes unused and ends
    up being landfilled, incinerated, disposed down the sewer, dumped, or spread
    onto land. The U.S. Government has set a 50% landfill diversion goal, that
    aims to cut the amount of food that goes to landfills and incineration in
    half. International goals, such as United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goal 12.3 or the European Union’s goals, aim to cut in half the amount of
    food going to eight destinations, including composting and anaerobic
    digestion, in addition to landfill.  [Visit our glossary for more

  title:
  summary: >-
    Food that is produced but never eaten still requires enormous resources to
    grow, harvest, transport, cool, cook or otherwise prepare – even when it’s
    disposed of. It’s an imprudent use of our food supply chain, and it has
    enormous impacts across our climate and natural resources, food insecurity,
    and the economy.

  title: Policy Overview
  summary: >-
    Public policy at the federal, state, and municipal levels can offer
    opportunities to accelerate large-scale food waste reduction. The Food Waste
    Policy Finder – developed by ReFED and the Harvard Law School Food Law and
    Policy Clinic to provide an overview of current federal and state policies
    related to food waste – depicts the existing policy landscape, while
    highlighting best-practice legislation in order to inform the continued
    development and implementation of sound food waste policy.

barriers_to_solutions_implementation:
  - title: Misalignment of Costs and Benefits
    description_html: >-
      <p>Businesses may be reluctant to implement a new technology or process if
      another part of the supply chain receives the benefit. They are also not
      incentivized to reduce the waste of their customers, as this could
      ultimately reduce sales.</p>
  - title: Lack Of Social License
    description_html: >-
      <p>Consumer expectations for product variety, convenience, low prices, and
      cosmetic perfection constrain businesses from streamlining their
      selection, offering cosmetically imperfect food, and reducing portion
      sizes.</p>
  - title: Information Gaps
    description_html: >-
      <p>There is uncertainty about where food waste occurs, how much is being
      wasted, and its associated value. As such, the costs of food waste are
      often invisible, and it&rsquo;s difficult to manage when it&rsquo;s not
      being measured. <em>[Visit ReFED's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      href="https://insights-engine.vercel.app/food-waste-monitor?view=overview&amp;year=2019">Insights
      Engine</a> for up-to-date facts about food waste.]</em></p>
  - title: Organizational Silos
    description_html: >-
      <p>Implementing food waste reduction solutions requires collaboration
      between different departments within participating businesses, including
      buyers, merchants, store managers, chefs, waste managers, and financial
      analysts. Employees in different parts of an organization may not be aware
      of the fully loaded cost implications of waste.</p>
  - title: Liability Concerns
    description_html: >-
      <p>The federal <a
      href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/about-us/partners/become-a-product-partner/food-partners">Good
      Samaritan Food Donation Act</a> protects donors and recipients from civil
      or criminal liability short of gross negligence and misconduct. Still,
      many are not aware of this protection, and even those who are may have
      concerns over public perception that could result from a food safety issue
      around donation. Food recovery organizations have robust systems to ensure
      safety, but many businesses are still skeptical.</p>
  - title: Fragmented Regulation
    description_html: >-
      <p>Health regulations vary by city and state, arising from &ldquo;home
      rule&rdquo; authority in some localities and differing interpretations of
      the FDA Food Code, which only loosely defines basic requirements for food
      safety. This hampers national and global companies from developing uniform
      food donation policies across their organizations.</p>
  - title: 'Handling, Transportation, And Storage'
    description_html: >-
      <p>Many consumer-facing businesses lack sufficient facilities to store
      food for donation. Food banks, pantries, soup kitchens, and other
      community organizations may similarly not have sufficient infrastructure
      or labor capacity to accept large donation volumes, especially of
      perishable foods requiring refrigeration or freezing. <em>[Check out our

      Provider Directory</a> to find organizations that can help support your
      food waste reduction initiatives.]</em></p>
  - title: Financial Viability
    description_html: >-
      <p>Donating food can involve additional handling costs beyond regular
      disposal. For example, state and federal tax benefits for recovered food
      rarely cover the farm labor costs involved. Without a way to recoup these
      costs, businesses are more likely to default to the path of least
      resistance: disposal.</p>
  - title: Cost Of Disposal
    description_html: >-
      <p>Landfill disposal rates (i.e., tipping fees) have remained
      exceptionally low in the U.S., relative to many other developed countries.
      Since tipping fees are typically the largest revenue streams for recycling
      processing facilities, this has hurt the business case to expand organics
      recycling infrastructure.</p>
  - title: Material Supply Assurance
    description_html: >-
      <p>A long-term guarantee of material is necessary for recycling facilities
      to access project finance and maintain long-term profitability. However,
      most cities and businesses are reluctant to sign long-term waste supply
      contracts due to long-term price uncertainty.</p>
  - title: High Transportation And Logistics Costs
    description_html: >-
      <p>Once waste is collected and deposited to a transfer station, the
      distance that it must travel to a recycling facility versus a landfill
      becomes the key driver for system economics. If hauling costs to a
      recycling facility are high, haulers may not bring enough food scrap
      volumes to keep the facility at the high capacity rate needed to be
      profitable.</p>
  - title: Access To Financing
    description_html: >-
      <p>Food waste reduction solutions have varying return profiles based on
      their level of maturity, capital required, nature of the solution
      (for-profit, non-profit), and more. This can result in a lack &ndash; or
      perceived lack &ndash; of direct return on investment, competing internal
      initiatives (from a management/personnel bandwidth and budgeting
      perspective) at the adopter level, and poor matching of capital type to
      the appropriate project. A perceived risk of adopting new solutions (e.g.,
      new technology, operational disruptions, etc.) leads to higher return
      hurdles required to adopt the project. Additionally, capital-intensive
      projects require high upfront costs and are the most sensitive to
      variations in financing rates, which can be a differentiator for success.

  - title: Packaging And Contamination
    description_html: >-
      <p>The hassle of removing food from its packaging significantly reduces
      food recycling rates among businesses and consumers. Common contaminants
      include plastic, foam, or disposable food packaging that appears
      compostable but is not. The problem continues at the treatment facility.
      Compost or anaerobic digestion facilities that receive highly contaminated
      feedstock must spend more costs on pre- and post-processing, which may
      hurt profitability.</p>
  - title: Permitting And Siting
    description_html: >-
      <p>Compost and anaerobic digestion facilities have trouble rallying local
      support, because the benefits are often hidden to communities. For densely
      populated municipalities, a limited number of sites are feasible for
      centralized composting. In addition, communities often object to compost
      facilities from &ldquo;NIMBY&rdquo; concerns related to perceived odors,
      pests, or increased truck traffic, even though these impacts can vary
      greatly based on the management of the compost facility.</p>
  - title: End-Market Development
    description_html: >-
      <p>Recycling facilities must maintain high prices for their end products
      (compost, digestate, energy) to maintain financial viability over time.
      This is impacted by customer demand. Energy demand is massive and linked
      into regional markets. However, for anaerobic digestion projects, the
      sharp ups and downs of natural gas market prices make it challenging to
      finance projects that require stable, long-term cash flows. Compost
      markets are smaller and constrained by transportation costs. Therefore,
      market demand for compost must keep pace with the millions of new tons of
      compost generated, or else a market imbalance will negatively impact
      compost prices and system economics.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="editable">
          Food waste is often considered to be a singular problem, but it&rsquo;s an entirely different situation when hundreds of tons of broccoli go unharvested on a farm compared to a half-full platter of uneaten potatoes being scraped into the trash at home. Waste occurs at each stage of the supply chain, with the majority happening at consumer-facing businesses &ndash; like grocery stores, restaurants, and other businesses that sell and serve food &ndash; and in homes. But because food waste is also systemic in nature, it&rsquo;s important to recognize that what happens at one stage is often influenced by something that happens at another stage, either upstream or downstream. For example, the farm referenced above may not harvest all of its broccoli, because it doesn&rsquo;t meet appearance specifications set by the retailers that purchase its produce.

          Which foods get wasted
        </h3>
        <div class="editable">
          <p><strong>Nearly 80%</strong> of surplus food is <em>perishable</em> <em>food</em>, which includes fruits and vegetables, meats, prepared fresh deli items, seafood, milk and dairy, and some grain products such as bread and bakery items. Perishables often get discarded, because they can be inexpensive and quickly go bad. In contrast, <em>non-perishable foods</em> &mdash; pastas, canned goods, and highly processed, shelf-stable products &mdash; are generally wasted less, because they don&rsquo;t spoil as easily. Pound per pound, fruits and vegetables are among the least expensive and fastest-spoiling foods; not surprisingly, they constitute more than <strong>35%</strong> of total food waste. Conversely, seafood and meats are the most expensive food types and the two least wasted.</p>

      What causes food waste?
    </h3>
    <p class="editable">
      The reasons for food waste are numerous and complex across the food supply chain. And with the advent of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://covid.refed.com/">COVID-19</a>, the challenges of keeping food from going to waste have only grown. Here are some insights into why it occurs:

              Farms
            </h3>
            <div class="editable my-2">
              <p>Food loss starts at the production level. Low market prices and high harvest costs often make it uneconomical for farmers to gather all that they produce. Strict cosmetic standards result in insufficient demand for imperfect-looking produce. Labor shortages cause further challenges. Despite gleaning and farm-to-food-bank efforts to recover unharvested food, the vast majority is left in the fields and tilled under. With foodservice closings during COVID, farms that typically sold to those markets found themselves with huge surpluses that ultimately went to waste.</p>

              Manufacturers
            </h3>
            <div class="editable">
              <p>The vast majority of surplus in food processing is byproducts &ndash; the peels, stems, bones, and other parts not used in the main product. Many of these trimmings, such as potato peels from french fry lines, are still edible. The wide variety of products sold causes inefficiencies as well &ndash; each time a production line is changed, it must be emptied and cleaned. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some food manufacturers saw a tripling in demand, but others struggled to adjust their output to meet the needs of new customers with different product requirements &ndash; for example, manufacturers who had always produced milk in large containers for industrial markets were unable to quickly begin offering their products in smaller, consumer-friendly sizes.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="editable">
              <p>Customer demand for a variety and quality of food being readily available strains inventory management and food purchasing, and it can be difficult to change stocking practices or product sizes &ndash; especially when those practices are tied to a retailer's brand identity. High customer standards for freshness can lead businesses to dispose of safe, edible food based on a perception that it's past its prime. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, retailers faced unexpected upticks in demand, as consumers rushed to stock up and make bulk purchases to limit their trips to the store; many retailers found it difficult to accurately order correct amounts of stock, leading to shortages and waste.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="editable my-2">
              <p>Poor food management leads to spoilage and ultimately drives food waste in homes. Many consumer purchases are unplanned, which can lead to over-purchasing, and many families are tempted into bulk purchases of food they will never consume to get a good deal on per-unit costs. Many consumers also lack the knowledge of how to repurpose ingredients and store food properly. (It&rsquo;s important to note that some of this is changing due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has driven consumers to prepare more meals at home, thereby helping to improve their food management and kitchen skills.) Misunderstanding of date labels often leads consumers to throw away food before it&rsquo;s spoiled, causing an estimated <strong>8%</strong> of at-home food waste. Many consumers also have limited access to municipal food waste recycling programs and perceive barriers to composting at home.</p>

            </h3>
            <div class="editable my-2">
              <p>Similar to retailers, foodservice customers expect a variety and quality of food to be available &ndash; and in the case of fast-food restaurants and other businesses with similar formats, customers expect it as soon as they place their order. Difficulty in forecasting, bulk purchasing, and improper storage can all lead to waste, along with preparation techniques that can leave usable food behind. Foodservice businesses have been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, as mandated lockdowns and ongoing customer apprehensions over safety have led to huge decreases in business. Sudden closures left many restaurants with excess food, which they struggled to repurpose through different selling methods (e.g., creating mini-markets to sell unused ingredients) or donations.</p>

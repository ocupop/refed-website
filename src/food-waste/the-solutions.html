    description_html: >-
      <ul><li><strong>Significant Involvement by the Ultimate Solution Adoptor -
      </strong>Adopting solutions will require food businesses, such as
      retailers, food service operators, restaurants, manufacturers,
      distributors, and producers, to contribute financial and human capital, as
      well as overall behavioral change. Many food waste solutions have an
      expected return on investment that can meet return thresholds of these
      entities; they just need to understand the direct, measurable, and
      tangible benefit to the business in order to devote organizational
      bandwidth to these opportunities. Corporate investment decisions largely
      occur because many solutions are simply good business decisions. Many food
      waste prevention solutions can positively impact corporate operations,
      thereby requiring the use of Corporate Finance and Spending. Certain
      solution providers or technology companies whose customers are food
      businesses may be viewed as strategic targets for
      acquisition.</li><li><strong>The Power of Catalytic Capital to De-Risk
      Innovation and Adoption - </strong>Catalytic Capital tends to be the first
      money-in, thereby having a multiplier effect of stimulating larger amounts
      of future funding and overcoming system-level barriers. For example, many
      food waste solutions with valuable social and environmental benefits are
      not financed due to marginal profitability or the lack of proven,
      market-based, revenue generating business models. Catalytic Capital
      (including Government Grants, Non-Government Grants, and Impact-First
      Investments) can uniquely shift the economics of these projects above the
      necessary hurdle rate to attract market-rate
      financing.</li><li><strong>Still Plenty of Opportunities for Alpha among
      Private Investors, Including Venture Capital - </strong>With
      ever-increasing funding round sizes, the first &ndash; of possibly many
      &ndash; food waste unicorns (Apeel Sciences), and growing recognition of
      the significant profit boosting potential for food companies in an already
      tight margin business, private investors, especially venture capitalists,
      have an important role to play in scaling and firmly establishing food
      waste as an investment category. Particularly, this form of capital can
      continue to fund cutting-edge innovation (especially as technology and
      reducing food waste often go hand-in-hand, including hardware- and
      software-driven solutions) and disruptive business models with a large
      potential total addressable market. We have seen new market-based
      innovations continuing to emerge with no signs of slowing down, as well as
      several early stage food waste solution providers beginning to become
      household names, challenging existing later stage and legacy brands and
      services.</li><li><strong>Building Infrastructure with Commercial and
      Government Project Finance -</strong> Project Finance is necessary to be
      able to cover the sheer size of financial commitment for the build out of
      facilities, equipment, and transportation, which are required to collect
      edible food for donations and sustainably dispose of food that was
      originally going to landfill. In a low interest rate environment, Project
      Finance can come at a historically lower cost. Enabling equipment and
      technologies, such as grinders for Centralized Composting and depackagers
      for Centralized Anaerobic Digestion, are not necessarily products that get
      the most attention but are vital for these processes. Local and regional
      capital in the form of philanthropy can also be useful in funding gaps in
      financing or higher risk opportunities.</li></ul>

  - title: Policy
    description_html: >-
      <p>Legislative and regulatory actions can ease or enable the
      implementation of food waste reduction solutions. Policy and regulation
      are especially effective in overcoming challenges where there are 1)
      misaligned incentives between who is funding a solution and who is
      receiving the benefit; and 2) the necessity for pre-competitive business
      standards (e.g., food safety regulations). Additionally, federal policy
      plays an important role when differing state policies can make solutions
      implementation difficult (e.g., by standardizing conflicting data labeling
      requirements).</p>
    icon_image: /img/icons/levers/levers_policy.svg
  - title: Innovation
    description_html: >-
      <p>The implementation of existing solutions can reduce a significant
      amount of food from going to waste across the supply chain. But there is
      still a need for new innovations to accelerate the adoption of these
      solutions and to develop new products, technologies, and business models
      to close the gaps where solutions either don&rsquo;t exist or are
      struggling to adequately scale.</p>
    icon_image: /img/icons/levers/levers_innovation.svg
  - title: Engagement
    description_html: >-
      <p>Multi-stakeholder or systems-level communication, education, and
      training can facilitate the adoption of food waste reduction solutions.
      Because it&rsquo;s a system-wide problem, reducing food waste often
      requires collaboration among different sectors; building and using
      cross-sector relationships can accelerate or even enable solutions to be
      implemented in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Employee Training and
      Incentives -</strong> Expand employee training and waste reduction
      incentive programs within operations to increase adherence to proper food
      safety, handling, and preparation protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System
      Information Sharing - </strong>Encourage data-enabled coordination and
      transparency across multiple stakeholders to address the current gaps in
      information and communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive
      Collaboration - </strong>Share pre-competitive industry knowledge to
      leverage expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build
      out, and streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior
      Change -</strong> Contribute to the collective efforts in culture and
      behavior change to emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction,
      and food management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging
      More Players - </strong>Conduct outreach and education to engage new
      businesses, policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community
      organizations in adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>

          <p>Food waste has enormous impacts on our environment, food insecurity, the economy, and more, but a range of solutions already exist to reduce it. Some are breakthrough, some are basic best practices, and many have a strong potential for investment returns. Many businesses, jurisdictions, nonprofits, funders, and others are already making a substantial impact to address the challenge. But much more needs to be done to achieve national and international goals to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 class="editable">
          Based on an extensive analysis of public and proprietary data from across the entire food system, ReFED estimates that the U.S. can achieve a reduction in food waste of 43 million tons, deliver $109 billion in annual net economic benefit for the country, avoid 70 million tons of GHGs, rescue <strong>AA</strong> meals, create 64,000 jobs &ndash; <em>and</em> achieve our 2030 reduction goal &ndash; by investing $17 billion per year over the next ten years to implement food waste prevention, rescue, and recycling solutions.

          <p>These are the seven areas where the food system must focus its efforts to make a meaningful reduction in the amount of food going to waste across the food supply chain. They align with the food recovery hierarchy of <em>prevention</em> (stopping waste from occurring in the first place), <em>rescue</em> (redistributing food at risk of going to waste to people), and <em>recycling</em> (repurposing waste as energy, agricultural, and other products). A focus on these seven areas can make a meaningful reduction in the amount of food going to waste across the food supply chain. We&rsquo;ve placed a focus on articulating <em>prevention</em>-related action areas, as they typically have the greatest financial and environmental impact compared to the investment required, yet have received less attention than <em>rescue</em> and <em>recycling</em> in the past.</p>

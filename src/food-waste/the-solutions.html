      <ul><li><strong>Significant Involvement by the Ultimate Solution Adoptor -
      </strong>Adopting solutions will require food businesses, such as
      retailers, food service operators, restaurants, manufacturers,
      distributors, and producers, to contribute financial and human capital, as
      well as overall behavioral change. Many food waste solutions have an
      expected return on investment that can meet return thresholds of these
      entities; they just need to understand the direct, measurable, and
      tangible benefit to the business in order to devote organizational
      bandwidth to these opportunities. Corporate investment decisions largely
      occur because many solutions are simply good business decisions. Many food
      waste prevention solutions can positively impact corporate operations,
      thereby requiring the use of Corporate Finance and Spending. Certain
      solution providers or technology companies whose customers are food
      businesses may be viewed as strategic targets for
      acquisition.</li><li><strong>The Power of Catalytic Capital to De-Risk
      Innovation and Adoption - </strong>Catalytic Capital tends to be the first
      money-in, thereby having a multiplier effect of stimulating larger amounts
      of future funding and overcoming system-level barriers. For example, many
      food waste solutions with valuable social and environmental benefits are
      not financed due to marginal profitability or the lack of proven,
      market-based, revenue generating business models. Catalytic Capital
      (including Government Grants, Non-Government Grants, and Impact-First
      Investments) can uniquely shift the economics of these projects above the
      necessary hurdle rate to attract market-rate
      financing.</li><li><strong>Still Plenty of Opportunities for Alpha among
      Private Investors, Including Venture Capital - </strong>With
      ever-increasing funding round sizes, the first &ndash; of possibly many
      &ndash; food waste unicorns (Apeel Sciences), and growing recognition of
      the significant profit boosting potential for food companies in an already
      tight margin business, private investors, especially venture capitalists,
      have an important role to play in scaling and firmly establishing food
      waste as an investment category. Particularly, this form of capital can
      continue to fund cutting-edge innovation (especially as technology and
      reducing food waste often go hand-in-hand, including hardware- and
      software-driven solutions) and disruptive business models with a large
      potential total addressable market. We have seen new market-based
      innovations continuing to emerge with no signs of slowing down, as well as
      several early stage food waste solution providers beginning to become
      household names, challenging existing later stage and legacy brands and
      services.</li><li><strong>Building Infrastructure with Commercial and
      Government Project Finance -</strong> Project Finance is necessary to be
      able to cover the sheer size of financial commitment for the build out of
      facilities, equipment, and transportation, which are required to collect
      edible food for donations and sustainably dispose of food that was
      originally going to landfill. In a low interest rate environment, Project
      Finance can come at a historically lower cost. Enabling equipment and
      technologies, such as grinders for Centralized Composting and depackagers
      for Centralized Anaerobic Digestion, are not necessarily products that get
      the most attention but are vital for these processes. Local and regional
      capital in the form of philanthropy can also be useful in funding gaps in
      financing or higher risk opportunities.</li></ul>

  - title: Policy
    description_html: >-
      <p>Legislative and regulatory actions can ease or enable the
      implementation of food waste reduction solutions. Policy and regulation
      are especially effective in overcoming challenges where there are 1)
      misaligned incentives between who is funding a solution and who is
      receiving the benefit; and 2) the necessity for pre-competitive business
      standards (e.g., food safety regulations). Additionally, federal policy
      plays an important role when differing state policies can make solutions
      implementation difficult (e.g., by standardizing conflicting data labeling
      requirements).</p><ul><li><strong>Disincentivize, Limit, or Ban Food from
      Landfills &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Organic waste bans prohibit food waste
      from being sent to landfills, which in turn compels any business or other
      organization subject to the law (there are sometimes thresholds) to reduce
      their food waste. Organic waste bans are one of the most powerful ways to
      not only require recovery or recycling, but also incentivize preventive
      measures and food donations while also enabling measurement. Seven states
      currently have laws of this nature, as do several localities.
      Alternatively, while not as strong, increasing landfill tipping fees can
      achieve some of the same results by disincentivizing waste
      overall.</li><li><strong>Incentivize Innovations that Reduce Food Waste -
      </strong>[Federal, State, Local; Legislative/Regulatory] Rebates, tax
      deductions, or other incentives to spur adoption of existing technologies
      and encourage innovation of new ones could be granted to businesses that
      employ technologies that demonstrate an ability to reduce food waste by at
      least 10%.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expand Federal Food Donation Enhanced Tax
      Deduction or create State-Level Tax Incentive for Non-Profit Sales and
      Transportation Services -</strong> [Federal, State; Legislative] Under
      current law, in order for a donor to claim the federal enhanced deduction
      for food donation, donations must go to a non-profit organization that
      does not charge the end recipient for the food, thus excluding tax
      deductions for social supermarkets that sell donated food at an extremely
      discounted price, or food recovery organizations that charge $1 to
      recipients to help offset the costs of home delivery of donated foods.
      Expanding the federal enhanced tax deduction (or creating new state-level
      credits or deductions) to cover donations to the ultimate recipient at a
      deeply reduced price would help incentivize innovation in food recovery
      and donation. In addition, expanding the deduction (or creating new
      state-level credits or deductions) to cover transport services would help
      overcome one of the most expensive barriers to food recovery. These
      incentives could be provided at the federal or state
      level.</li><li><strong>Expand Farm to Food Bank Programs </strong>&ndash;
      [Federal; Legislative] To reduce the financial barrier of farmers donating
      food, governments can set aside funds to cover the harvesting, processing,
      packaging, and transportation costs of donating agricultural products to
      food banks. Federally, Congress could continue the Farm to Food Bank
      Program (FTFB), authorized for $4 million/year in the 2018 Farm Bill as
      part of the Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP),&nbsp; increase the
      funding for the program, and waive the state fund matching requirement.
      States can look to the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System (PASS) as
      a model.</li></ul>

  - title: Innovation
    description_html: >-
      <p>The implementation of existing solutions can reduce a significant
      amount of food from going to waste across the supply chain. But there is
      still a need for new innovations to accelerate the adoption of these
      solutions and to develop new products, technologies, and business models
      to close the gaps where solutions either don&rsquo;t exist or are
      struggling to adequately scale.</p><ul><li><strong>Data Integration
      -</strong> Currently, technologies exist to measure and share transit
      data, such as temperature, GPS tracking, and more, yet these technologies
      could be improved through greater integration into logistics and food
      rescue systems to improve communication and supply chain visibility of
      product quality in real time, ultimately allowing for more informed
      decisions according to shelf life.</li><li><strong>Cost-Efficient Tech -
      </strong>Research and development are needed to drive costs for emerging
      technologies and processes that reduce waste yet are too expensive for
      scaling, including spoilage and instant pathogen detectors, temperature
      monitors, smart labels in retail, and home kitchen food management
      equipment.</li><li><strong>Contracts &amp; Business Models -
      </strong>Changes to existing contracting and business models are needed to
      re-center the value of food and labor, such as through whole crop
      purchasing contracts on farms and earned revenue models that support
      hiring staff in food rescue organizations.</li><li><strong>Shared
      Platforms for Idle Assets - </strong>Matchmaking platforms can connect
      various assets, including cold storage, transportation, and even donatable
      food to the organizations in demand, thus streamlining communications and
      increasing access when needed.&nbsp;</li></ul>
    icon_image: /img/icons/levers/levers_innovation.svg
  - title: Engagement
    description_html: >-
      <p>Multi-stakeholder or systems-level communication, education, and
      training can facilitate the adoption of food waste reduction solutions.
      Because it&rsquo;s a system-wide problem, reducing food waste often
      requires collaboration among different sectors; building and using
      cross-sector relationships can accelerate or even enable solutions to be
      implemented in the first place.</p><ul><li><strong>Employee Training and
      Incentives</strong> - Staff participation and engagement in interactive
      employee training and waste reduction incentive programs can increase
      adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
      protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing </strong>-
      Data-enabled coordination and transparency platforms in new and existing
      partnerships can address the current gaps in information and improve
      accountability across the supply chain.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive
      Collaboration</strong> - Pre-competitive industry knowledge that is
      readily shared amongst partnerships can leverage existing expertise,
      encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build out, and streamline
      standardization, thus shifting to a higher standard of operational
      efficiency.</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change</strong> -
      Collective efforts of industry coalitions and governments in culture and
      behavior change can catalyze a broader audience and emphasize improved
      food utilization, waste reduction, and food management skills through
      education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players</strong> - Outreach and
      education can increase adoption of food waste reduction measures with new
      businesses, policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and encourage
      community organizations to share practical learnings, inspire new
      innovations, and identify potential partnerships.</li></ul>

          <p>Food waste has enormous impacts on our environment, food insecurity, the economy, and more, but a range of solutions already exist to reduce it. Some are breakthrough, some are basic best practices, and many have a strong potential for investment returns. Many businesses, jurisdictions, nonprofits, funders, and others are already making a substantial impact to address the challenge. But much more needs to be done to achieve national and international goals to reduce food waste by 50% by the year 2030.</p>

          Based on an extensive analysis of public and proprietary data from across the entire food system, ReFED estimates that the U.S. can achieve a reduction in food waste of 43 million tons, deliver $109 billion in annual net economic benefit for the country, avoid 70 million tons of GHGs, rescue <strong>AA</strong> meals, create 64,000 jobs &ndash; <em>and</em> achieve our 2030 reduction goal &ndash; by investing $17 billion per year over the next ten years to implement food waste prevention, rescue, and recycling solutions.

A focus on these seven areas can make a meaningful reduction in the amount of food going to waste across the food supply chain. We&rsquo;ve placed a focus on articulating <em>prevention</em>-related action areas, as they typically have the greatest financial and environmental impact compared to the investment required, yet have received less attention than <em>rescue</em> and <em>recycling</em> in the past.</p>

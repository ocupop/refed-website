              <p>In this week's interview, we hear from Robert Egger, founder of DC Central Kitchen, Campus Kitchens Projects, and LA Kitchen.</p>
              <p>Inspired by a volunteer experience feeding the needy, Robert Egger founded the community kitchen, DC Central Kitchen, in 1989. DC Central Kitchen collects wasted food from farms, restaurants, and grocers around Washington, D.C., and the community kitchen also provides culinary job training for individuals who face employment barriers. In addition, Robert founded LA Kitchen and Campus Kitchen Projects, which collectively have produced over 40 million meals and helped over 2,000 individuals attain jobs.</p>
              <p>Determined to &ldquo;squeeze every ounce of opportunity out of every pound of food&rdquo;, Robert&rsquo;s righteous enterprise and customer-centric model proves that it is profitable to buy reduced-price local produce and pay good wages while enabling economic opportunities for all.&nbsp; Going forward, Robert sees the necessity to promote effective environmentally-friendly food legislation that embraces the potential of social enterprises to combat food waste.</p>
              <p>Alexandria Coari from ReFED and Amy Ahearn from +Acumen sat down with Robert to hear the lessons he has learned from years of working on issues of food waste, food insecurity, and workforce development.</p>

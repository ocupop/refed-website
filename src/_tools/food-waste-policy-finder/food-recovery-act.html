            <p>Congresswoman Chellie Pingree first introduced HR4184, the <a class="external" href="https://pingree.house.gov/foodwaste/billtext">Food Recovery Act</a>, which is a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at reducing food waste and promoting food recovery, in 2015. The Food Recovery Act includes various provisions to encourage farms, groceries, restaurants, and institutions to donate excess food to food recovery nonprofits, along with regulations and funding measures that will raise awareness, encourage composting and anaerobic digestion programs, and reduce wasted food in schools and the federal government. The Food Recovery Act was re-introduced in 2017 in both the House and the Senate (H.R.3444, S. 1680).&nbsp;</p>

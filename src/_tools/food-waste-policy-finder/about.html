          <h1>About the policy finder</h1>
          <div class="editable"><p>Public policy can offer opportunities to accelerate large-scale food waste reduction. In the U.S., policy related to food waste exists at the federal, state, and municipal levels, though the characteristics of these policies and the extent to which they promote or impede food waste reduction vary significantly &mdash; whether they incentivize good practices, penalize bad behavior, or clarify what activities are allowed.</p><p><a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://www.refed.com/">ReFED</a> and the <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.chlpi.org/food-law-and-policy/about/">Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic</a> collaborated to develop the Food Waste Policy Finder in order to provide an overview of current federal and state policies related to food waste. The tool is intended to depict the existing policy landscape while highlighting best-practice legislation in order to promote the continued development and implementation of sound food waste policy.</p><p>The tool presents policies within the food waste hierarchy framework (prioritizing food waste prevention, followed by food recovery, and finally recycling solutions). Policy areas currently featured in the tool include: date labeling regulations, donation liability protections, donation tax incentives, animal feed regulations, and organic waste bans and waste recycling laws.</p><p>Policy research for this tool was conducted by the <a target="_blank" class="external" href="http://www.chlpi.org/food-law-and-policy/about/">Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic</a>, with state date labeling information produced by FLPC in partnership with the <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://www.nrdc.org/">Natural Resources Defense Council</a>&nbsp;and animal feed policy information produced by FLPC in partnership with the <a target="_blank" class="external" href="https://law.uark.edu/">University of Arkansas School of Law</a>.</p><p>Given the widespread support for food waste solutions, we anticipate the ongoing creation of new policy, and look forward to updating this tool accordingly. We also plan to add additional municipal-level policy information in the future. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@refed.com">info@refed.com</a> if you notice any outdated state laws or know of any policies we havenâ€™t yet added to the site.</p></div>

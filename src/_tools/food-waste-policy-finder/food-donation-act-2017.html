            <p>The farm bill is the largest piece of food and agriculture-related legislation in the United States. The 2018 Farm Bill, passed in December 2018, was the first Farm Bill to provide dedicated programming and resources to reduce food loss and waste. Some key provisions of the bill related to food waste include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Pilot Project to Support State and Local Composting and Food Waste Reduction Plans: creates a pilot project to support local governments in at least 10 states in developing and implementing compost and food waste reduction plans.</li>
              <li>Food Loss and Waste Liaison and Study on Food Waste: creates a Food Loss and Waste Reduction Liaison within USDA, charged with coordinating food waste reduction programs across federal agencies; raising awareness of food waste; and leading efforts to collect data through a study on food waste.</li>
              <li>Food Donation Standards for Liability Protections: extends liability protections to "qualified direct donors" &ndash; entities with food safety certification and licensing&ndash; that donate food directly to individuals in need, and requires USDA to develop guidance on liability protections for qualified direct donors.</li>
            </ul>

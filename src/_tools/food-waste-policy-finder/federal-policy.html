          <h3>Federal Liability Protection</h3>
          <p class="editable">Many food manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, strong federal liability protections exist for businesses that donate, and nonprofits that receive and distribute, donated food. In 1996, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ210/pdf/PLAW-104publ210.pdf">Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</a>, which provides a federal floor of civil and criminal liability protection for food donors and the nonprofit organizations that receive and distribute food donations to those in need, as long as certain requirements are met.</p>

          <h3>Federal Tax Incentives</h3>
          <p class="editable">Tax incentives make food donation more cost effective and economically beneficial. The federal government has recognized the importance of food donation and provides tax deductions for food donations to incentivize businesses to donate food. As of December 2015, all businesses &mdash; including C-corporations, S-corporations, limited liability corporations (LLCs), partnerships, and sole proprietorships &mdash; are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction for food donations that meet certain eligibility criteria. If they do not meet the criteria, food donations can still qualify for a general tax deduction in the amount of the food&rsquo;s basis value.</p>

          <h3>Federal Animal Feed Policy</h3>
          <p class="editable">The use of food waste as animal feed has been commonplace for centuries. This practice declined in the 1980s, when state and federal laws tried to limit the feeding of food waste to animals following several disease outbreaks linked to animal products in livestock feed. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the practice of feeding safe, properly treated food waste to animals.The federal government regulates the use of food scraps in animal feed by setting requirements which largely concern the type of animals that may be fed food scraps and the kind of food scraps that may be fed to animals. The federal regulations function as a floor that allows state regulations to go beyond them. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>The Food Recovery Act</h3>
          <p class="editable">Congresswoman Chellie Pingree introduced HR484, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3108?r=23">Food Recovery Act</a>, which is a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at reducing food waste and promoting food recovery, in 2015. The Food Recovery Act includes various provisions to encourage farms, groceries, restaurants, and institutions to donate excess food to food recovery nonprofits, along with regulations and funding measures that will raise awareness, encourage composting and anaerobic digestion programs, and reduce wasted food in schools and the federal government. The Food Recovery Act has also been <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/3108/committeeshttps://www.congress.gov/114/bills/s3108/BILLS-114s3108is.pdf.">introduced in the Senate</a> and is sponsored by U.S. Senators Brian Schatz (D-Hawai&lsquo;i), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Cory Booker (D-N.J.).</p>

          <h3>Food Date Labeling Act</h3>
          <p class="editable">No national uniform system for food date labeling exists in the U.S. In the absence of federal law, states enforce a variety of inconsistent date label regulations. The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr5298/text">Food Date Labeling Act</a> was proposed to the House and Senate on May 18, 2016, with the intent of establishing a uniform national system for date labeling that clearly distinguishes between foods that bear a label indicating quality from foods that bear a label indicating they may become unsafe to consume past the date. This bill would also ensure that food is allowed to be sold or donated after its quality date, and proposes to educate consumers about the meaning of new labels so that they can make better economic and safety decisions.</p>

          <h3>Food Donation Act of 2017</h3>
          <p class="editable">On February 7, 2017, Representatives Marcia L. Fudge (D-OH), Dan Newhouse (R-WA), Chellie Pingree (D-ME), and James P. McGovern (D-MA) introduced The Food Donation Act of 2017[AN1]  (H.R. 952), which will expand liability protection for food donation and reduce wasted food nationwide. The bill enhances the coverage of the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (Emerson Act), which promotes food donation by extending civil and criminal liability protection to food donors and food recovery organizations. The Emerson Act provides a broad base of liability protection that was intended to encourage food donations, yet donors are often unaware of the Actâ€™s protections. Many food manufacturers, retailers, and restaurants still cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. This legislation will help to clarify some of the ambiguous terms in the Emerson Act, promote awareness of the Act, and extend liability protection to support modern food donation.</p>

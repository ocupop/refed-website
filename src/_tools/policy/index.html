          <h2>Reducing Food Waste Through Good Policy</h2>
          <p>The Roadmap highlights a number of areas where policy can facilitate solutions that will reduce food waste by 20%. To achieve this, the immediate priority is to spread and advocate for best-practice policies at the local and state levels. Reaching greater long-term goals will likely require a comprehensive federal food waste policy that sets national guidelines.</p>
          <p>Enacting supportive food waste reduction policies has the potential to clear up consumer confusion about date labeling, spur increased donations to food recovery e orts, incentivize more businesses to reduce food waste, and develop more robust food waste recycling infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>Spotlight on date<br>labeling regulations</h2>
          <p>Current date labeling practices on food packaging cause confusion that leads to 20% of consumer waste of safe, edible food. Five to 10% of this could be impacted by standardizing policy around date labeling.</p>

          <p>Despite laudable efforts by a wide array of organizations, the vast majority of the 36 million tons of unsold food inventory generated within the value chain annually does not get recovered and distributed to people in need. Recovery efforts have historically been led by highly localized nonprofit organizations <a href="https://www.refed.com/tools/innovator-database/">(86% of US recovery organizations are nonprofits and 75% are local in reach)</a> that are often dependent on philanthropic funding, physical infrastructure and volunteer labor. While this model has been successful in feeding many of the food insecure on a local basis, it has proven challenging to scale nationally, or even regionally.</p>
          <p>With nearly 40 million Americans facing food insecurity, there is an enormous need and opportunity for recovery organizations to deliver more food at scale and become operationally sustainable. Launching in September 2019, ReFED&rsquo;s Nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator will apply years of learning into a three-month program that will equip participants with the knowledge, network and capital they need to scale their impact by implementing earned revenue models and human-centered technology solutions. Learn about a few examples of these efforts already underway <a href="/content-hub/new-ingredients-key-to-sustainable-growth">here</a>.</p>

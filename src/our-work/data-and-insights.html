          <p>Leveraging Data and Insights to Highlight Supply Chain Inefficiencies and Economic Opportunities</p>
        </div>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>While we know roughly how much food is wasted, the causes, the impacts on the environment and economy and the solutions, one of the key challenges in the field is lack of data both on the problem itself and on the most effective solutions. At ReFED, we continue to set the pace to support measurement and action to reduce food waste in the U.S., by being the definitive source of data and economic analysis, and moving the food system from acting on instinct to insight-driven actions. To further support the food waste sector, ReFED&rsquo;s Data and Insights leverages compelling data and insights to highlight supply chain inefficiencies and economic opportunities.</p>
          <p>Starting with the 2016 Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste by 20 Percent, ReFED has developed a trusted history of producing first-of-their-kind tools and resources that provide a full-supply-chain picture of U.S. food waste, cost-effective solutions to the problem, credible data and accessible methods to track progress. While that initial report was an extremely successful start, the field is ever evolving and we need the data to catalyze and enable that growth.</p>
          <p>As such, we&rsquo;ve developed the ReFED Insights Engine, an online data center designed to serve as the next generation of data, insights, and guidance on U.S. food waste. This interactive platform combines over 50 public and proprietary datasets, and subject matter expertise from our Expert Network, a group of over 75 food system professionals who span across the private and public sectors.</p>

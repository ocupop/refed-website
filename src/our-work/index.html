  title: Covid-19
  summary: COVID-19 has sent shock waves through our entire food system — from producers to end recipients — resulting in a surge of on-farm food loss, food business closures, labor shortages, and a growing number of food insecure individuals. By leveraging our central role as a convening organization within the food waste space, ReFED launched several funding initiatives, webinar series, and resource guides to inspire collaborations between businesses, innovators, funders, and, service organizations to help them adapt to this new reality.

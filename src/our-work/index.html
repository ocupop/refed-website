  title: Our COVID-19 Response
  summary: >-
    COVID-19 has sent shock waves through our entire food system — from
    producers to end recipients — resulting in a surge of on-farm food loss,
    food business closures, labor shortages, and a growing number of food
    insecure individuals. By leveraging our central role as a convening
    organization within the food waste space, ReFED launched several funding
    initiatives, webinar series, and resource guides to inspire collaborations
    between businesses, innovators, funders, and, service organizations to help
    them adapt to this new reality.

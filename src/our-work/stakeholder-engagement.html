      <p>On October 18, 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
      (&ldquo;EPA&rdquo;), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (&ldquo;FDA&rdquo;), and U.S. Department of Agriculture
      (&ldquo;USDA&rdquo;) signed a formal agreement with ReFED committing to
      increase collaboration and coordination in areas of mutual interest
      relating to the reduction of food loss and waste.&nbsp;</p>
    text_below_logos_html: >-
      <p>The <a
      href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2019-04/documents/refed-epa-usda-fda_formal_agreement.pdf">formal
      agreement</a> indicates that:</p><ol><li>The Federal Parties intend to
      identify and develop non-exclusive opportunities for collaboration between
      ReFED and federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local government
      officials in efforts to reduce food waste in the United
      States.</li><li>The Federal Parties intend to consult as appropriate with
      ReFED to develop approaches for measuring the success of various
      strategies and techniques currently being deployed nationwide to reduce
      food waste.&nbsp;</li><li>The Federal Parties intend to participate as
      appropriate in the <em>Further with Food: Center for Food Loss and Waste
      Solutions </em>(https://furtherwithfood.org) public-private partnership,
      where ReFED serves as the Host.&nbsp;</li><li>The Parties intend to
      leverage existing platforms and partnerships to advance data collection
      and measurement activities related to food loss and
      waste.&nbsp;</li><li>The Parties expect to meet periodically to provide
      updates on progress being made in food waste reduction efforts and meet at
      minimum bi-yearly throughout the life of this formal
      agreement.&nbsp;</li><li>ReFED intends to annually provide a two-page
      summary of observations from that calendar year of strides being made to
      reduce food waste across the country. The summary is anticipated to also
      identify where action or involvement by the Federal Parties may result in
      reduction of food loss and waste.&nbsp;</li><li>The Parties intend to
      share this formal agreement, including a link to this agreement, on
      relevant websites and/or social media.&nbsp;</li><li>Subsequent to the
      signing of this formal agreement, the Parties expect to identify a more
      detailed list of actions and responsibilities that reflect the above
      terms.&nbsp;</li></ol>

          <p>Food waste represents a unique opportunity to generate a positive financial, social, and environmental return on investment. To make that happen, it will require stakeholders to collaborate and coordinate across the value chain. ReFED facilitates this by building high-value partnerships and incentivizing new players into the food waste space, through it&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement team.</p>
          <p>ReFED&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement team focuses on convening a network of influential thought leaders and decision-makers across private and public entities to enable collective action around food waste solutions and issues that require a systems-based approach. This includes managing ReFED&rsquo;s internal and external advisory structures, ReFED&rsquo;s industry and sector partnerships, and hosting the annual Food Waste Summit.</p>

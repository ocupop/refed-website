          <p>Food waste represents a unique opportunity to generate a positive financial, social, and environmental return on investment. To make that happen, it will require stakeholders to collaborate and coordinate across the value chain. ReFED facilitates this by building high-value partnerships, identifying unique groups strengths to make progress together, and incentivizing new players into the food waste space, through it&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement team.</p>
          <p>ReFED&rsquo;s Stakeholder Engagement team focuses on convening a network of influential thought leaders and decision-makers across private and public entities to enable collective action around food waste solutions and issues that require a systems-based approach. This includes managing ReFED&rsquo;s industry and sector partnerships, ReFED&rsquo;s internal and external advisory structures, and hosting cross-sector events, including the annual Food Waste Summit.</p>

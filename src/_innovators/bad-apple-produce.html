  Bad Apple Produce is a New York City metro area produce delivery service with
  a mission to reduce food waste. We source produce at risk of ending up in a
  landfill for no good reason (whether it's the wrong size, shape, or color for
  commercial markets, or in excess supply), and deliver it to households at up
  to a 50% discount to retail prices. Every week, we post an availability list
  of between 30 to 40 items, and customers can select exactly what they want. We
  donate all of our excess produce to local hunger relief organizations and
  education nonprofits.

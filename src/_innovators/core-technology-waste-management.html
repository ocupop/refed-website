description: 'With WM’s CORe ® technology, we collect commercial food waste from restaurants, schools, food processing plants, and grocery stores, screen it to remove contaminants such as plastic, packaging, and  bones, and blend the waste into an engineered slurry that has a consistency similar to cooked oatmeal. 7% of this engineered slurry to a water treatment plant’s anaerobic digesters can increase energy output by more than 70%.  WM has full-scale facilities in Los Angeles, New York City and Boston and has processed over 10 million gallons of bioslurry since 2014.'

description: Meredith Tomason, owner of RareSweets pastry shop at CityÂ­CenterDC, buys the almond meal left over from Udderly Nuts almond milk to use as flour for gluten-free products. She has formed a new partnership with Undone Chocolate to turn the nibs that are a byproduct of chocolate bars into a cold-brewed chocolate drink for summer (one that should pair well with her sweets).

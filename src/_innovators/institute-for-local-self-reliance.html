  ILSRâ€™S COMPOSTING FOR COMMUNITY INITIATIVE IS ADVANCING COMPOSTING IN ORDER TO
  CREATE JOBS, ENHANCE SOILS, PROTECT THE CLIMATE, AND REDUCE WASTE. OUR
  OBJECTIVES ARE TO PROMOTE A PLACE-BASED DECENTRALIZED AND DIVERSE COMPOSTING
  INFRASTRUCTURE, IDENTIFY MODEL LOCAL AND STATE POLICIES, CATALYZE NEW
  COMPOSTING CAPACITY, AND TO EXPAND THE USE OF COMPOST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. WE
  HAVE TWO MAIN PROJECT AREAS:



  OUR CULTIVATING COMMUNITY COMPOSTING (CCC) PROJECT AIMS TO STRENGTHEN THE
  NASCENT COMMUNITY-SCALE COMPOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE VIA ADVANCING POLICIES;
  HOSTING FORUMS, WORKSHOPS, WEBINARS, AND OTHER NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES;
  IDENTIFYING MODELS; AND PROVIDING GUIDEBOOKS, TRAINING, AND TOOLKITS. OUR MOST
  RECENT CCC FORUM BROUGHT TOGETHER 60+ COMMUNITY-SCALE COMPOSTERS, AND WE ARE
  NOW FACILITATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL COMMUNITY COMPOSTER COALITION.



  IN 2014 WE LAUNCHED OUR NEIGHBORHOOD SOIL REBUILDERS (NSR) COMPOSTER TRAINING
  PROGRAM TO TRAIN COMMUNITY LEADERS IN THE ART & SCIENCE OF COMPOSTING. THIS
  REPLICABLE TRAIN-THE-TRAINER PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO ACT AS A MODEL FOR
  ENHANCING AND FOSTERING COMPOSTER TRAINING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, IN
  ORDER TO IMPROVE AND INCREASE COMPOSTING AT THE COMMUNITY-SCALE NATIONWIDE. TO
  DATE, WE HAVE TRAINED 120+ COMPOSTERS IN DC, GA, MD, NE, VA AND CONTINUE TO
  EXPAND.



  ILSR'S MISSION IS TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES, WORKING MODELS AND TIMELY
  INFORMATION TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND AND EQUITABLE COMMUNITY
  DEVELOPMENT. TO THIS END, ILSR WORKS WITH CITIZENS, ACTIVISTS, POLICYMAKERS AND
  ENTREPRENEURS: TO DESIGN SYSTEMS, POLICIES AND ENTERPRISES THAT MEET LOCAL OR
  REGIONAL NEEDS; TO MAXIMIZE HUMAN, MATERIAL, NATURAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES;
  AND TO ENSURE THAT THE BENEFITS OF THESE SYSTEMS AND RESOURCES ACCRUE TO ALL
  LOCAL CITIZENS. WE WORK WITH A DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF PEOPLE AND
  ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY.

  Natural Cuts is the byproduct of years of hard science research, married with
  an astute eye for customer needs.



  The science behind Natural Cuts was developed by a team of Cornell University
  food scientists who had themselves experienced the problems caused by the
  relatively short shelf lives of fresh produce. Vipul Saran, one of our
  co-founders and an entrepreneur, has spent a significant portion of his life in
  the agricultural sector both as a scientist and owner of a potato farming co-op
  in India. His empathy for the problems faced by farmers in India and his
  entrepreneurial spirit drove him to commercialize his research into what is now
  Natural Cuts.



  Natural Cuts' offerings seek to solve key pain points for our customers through
  substantially increased shelf-life and reduced caloric value without
  sacrificing product quality. Natural Cuts' products do not require
  refrigeration or freezing, greatly reducing their environmental impact through
  reduced energy utilization.

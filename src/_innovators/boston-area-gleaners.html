description: 'Boston Area Gleaners is a nonprofit dedicated to rescuing surplus farm crops for people in need. We organize gleaning trips to local farms, supervising volunteers as they harvest high-quality produce that would otherwise be plowed under. We then distribute the fresh, nutritious fruits and vegetables to food banks, pantries, and meal programs. Our goal is to build a reliable and sustainable supply chain between local farms and our most vulnerable community members. Our activities, in collaboration with food producers and hunger relief agencies, contribute to efforts to build a sustainable and equitable local food system.'

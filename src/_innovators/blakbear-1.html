  We are an advanced analytics company using sensors integrated in food
  packaging that send out live data to our software platform to give freshness
  visibility across the chain. We add shelf-life to perishable products like
  fish, meat, and poultry by measuring food directly. We change First In, First
  Out (FIFO) to First Expired, First Out (FEFO). More shelf-life means there is
  more time to sell the product.  1) The food is less likely to get spoiled and
  wasted (reduce waste), 2) And less likely to ever be out-of-stock (demand
  always met).

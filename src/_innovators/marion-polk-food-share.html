  Our mission is to lead the fight to end hunger in Marion and Polk counties …
  because no one should be hungry.
   
   This month, as with every month, more than 46,000 people – including 15,000 children – will access emergency food through the Marion-Polk Food Share partner network. This food may be a hot meal served at a shelter, a free community meal served at a church, or an emergency food box from a food pantry. This nutritious food will help children and adults learn, work and thrive.

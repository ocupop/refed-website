description: "Forgotten Harvest “rescued” 40.9 million pounds of food last year by collecting surplus prepared and perishable food from 800 sources.  This donated food, which would otherwise go to waste, is delivered free-of-charge to 250 emergency food providers in the Metro Detroit area. Forgotten Harvest recently began a co-branding program with local manufacturers to increase brand exposure and bring in additional revenue to both parties. "

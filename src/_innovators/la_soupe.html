description: Headed by chef Suzy DeYoung, La Soupe rescues otherwise wasted produce to create delicious and highly-nutritious meals for customers, non-profits and food-insecure families. During the week we create soups, cassoulets, gumbos, stews and anything else that can be shared in a pot. On the weekend we create large batches of soup and deliver them to local partners who feed the hungry.

description: "Amp Your Good’s crowd-feeding platform radically changes and improves how food drives work. Our goal is to change the way people think about food drives so we’ve re-imagined them using the same sharing economy principles as Uber, AirBnB and others to make a difference in the lives of those struggling with hunger."

description: >-
  The NETZRO platform creates more food and less waste by processing food
  by-products and upcycling to high value food ingredients. We do this using a
  proprietary food processing technology that kills pathogens without degrading
  nutrient value creating new shelf stable safe food ingredients that can be
  used in everyday food products. Our two current projects are recovering and
  reharvesting egg shells and brewery/distillery spent grain.

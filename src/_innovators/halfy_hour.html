description: "Halfy Hour allows restaurants to post their food at whatever discount they want, at any time of the day. Restaurants are also able to set recurring deals, so they don't have to open the app each day-- the pre-chosen number of deals will automatically be added to their menu each day at the specified time.  Halfy Hour is great for restaurants looking to promote their store to thousands of people nearby, and Halfy Hour also provides a way for restaurants that have surplus food at the end of the day to sell that food on a short time frame."

description: 'Electro-Active Technologies is developing a food waste conversion technology
  to produce zero emission fuel (H2) and a by-product which can be used either as
  a soil additive or as an animal feed. Electro-Active Technologies fights food waste
  via a three-fold approach: 1. Preventing  food waste from going to landfill and
  releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas, 2. Conversion of food waste into a value
  added product, with potential up-cycling of the waste to animal feed and 3. Return
  of key nutrients back to soil via conversion of waste into a soil additive'

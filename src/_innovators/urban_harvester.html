description: 'Urban Harvester was founded as a non-profit in 2012; since 2009, weâ€™ve been designing plans, policy, and procedures to address excess professionally made fresh food so it can be donated appropriately. By proper matching, vetting, site visits, advance planning, education and policy, we successfully divert the gift of food from needless waste.  We connect grocery stores, restaurants and other food providers directly to non-profit agencies reaching from major city centers to communities with limited access to fresh food.'

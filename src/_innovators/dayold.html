description: We sell delicious surplus baked goods (from brownies to cinnamon rolls to artisan loaves of bread!) through treat boxes, office pop-ups, and event catering. Our baked goods are surplus â€” we collect them from artisan bakeries the previous day, preventing them from going to waste. Our profits become much-needed cash donations to charities addressing child hunger.

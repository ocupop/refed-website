description: "Wefood sells goods that regular supermarkets can no longer sell due to overdue ‘best before’ dates, incorrect labels or damaged packaging. The products found in Wefood are still edible and safe to consume according to the Danish food legislation, but have simply lost their value to the partner donating them."

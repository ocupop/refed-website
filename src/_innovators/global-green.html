  Global Green - the US arm of Green Cross International - is a national
  organization working to build sustainable programs and smart solutions to
  climate change and additional environmental challenges, particularly within
  disadvantaged communities. We have partnered with the City of Santa Monica to
  create a Food Waste Prevention and Rescue Program for the City’s businesses.
  The Program is a key step in helping the City meet its goal of 90% waste
  diversion by 2030, and will ultimately assist the City’s local businesses to
  prevent wasted food, recycle food scraps, and donate excess edible food to
  those that need it most.

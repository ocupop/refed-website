description: Blue Mangoes designs solar fruit dehydrators which work without any electricity
  generation. These technologies are employed across the world and American urban
  farmers, transforming would-be overabundant and wasted fruits into all-natural and
  ethically-sourced products. We use byproducts of fruit drying (seeds/pits, juice,
  and excess pulp) to create new products.

description: "Too Good To Go is a global social enterprise dedicated to tackling food waste in the restaurant and catering industry. We've created an online and app-based platform that allows restaurants, cafes and bakeries that produce surplus food to sell it at their end of service rather than throw it in the bin. Too Good To Go started in Denmark in November 2015 and has since expanded as far out as the Americas and Australia. "

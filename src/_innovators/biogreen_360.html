description: "This self-contained, automated unit provides the ultimate on-site food waste management to companies and organizations that produce or serve food. During a 24-hour period, a supermarket or restaurant can feed up to 1,500 pounds of food waste into the unit, which liquefies and dries the waste, producing a ribbon of material weighing only 10% of the original waste."

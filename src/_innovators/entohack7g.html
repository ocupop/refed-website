description: >-
  EntoHack7G is a food waste processing operation and consultancy that provides
  a valuable and much needed alternative to landfills. EntoHack7G is developing
  a 100,000 square foot organic waste processing facility in Jersey City, New
  Jersey capable of processing 100 tons of waste every day. 


  Working with restaurants, grocery stores, and other major food waste
  producers, waste is diverted from landfills to EntoHack7G's processing
  facility. There, black soldier flies are used to break down waste
  naturallyâ€”their core biological function. As a result, the nutrient rich
  larvae can be processed into new organic products like feed grade protein,
  fertilizer, and compounds that are used in everything from make-up to
  bio-diesel fuel.

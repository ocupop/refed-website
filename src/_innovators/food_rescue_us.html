description: "Food Rescue US is committed to ending American food insecurity by directly transferring fresh, usable food that would have otherwise been thrown away from restaurants, grocers and other food industry sources to food insecure families throughout the U.S. The unique use of our award-winning proprietary mobile technology increases access to fresh produce and perishables that are not available through the traditional warehouse models of food delivery that have long dominated the hunger and food-insecurity sectors.

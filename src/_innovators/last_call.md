description: Two George Washington University students, Erin McGeoy and Chloe King,
  started Last Call in 2018 as a way to provide more affordable meal options to their
  community of college students, all while helping local businesses reduce their food
  waste. Last Call is an online platform that allows restaurants, cafes, and grocery
  stores to discount surplus food they may otherwise throw out, providing high-quality
  meals to the community for $5 or less. Last Call notifies users of the discounted
  food available for purchase through the platform, effectively driving traffic to
  participating stores in off hours or near closing, and helping their partners sell
  out instead of throw out valuable food.

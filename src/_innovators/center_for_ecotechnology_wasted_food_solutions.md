description: The Center for EcoTechnology (CET) helps people and businesses save energy
  and reduce waste. CET acts as a catalyst to accelerate the development of a vibrant
  marketplace to divert wasted food from the commercial and institutional sectors.
  Our job is to get to know all the solution providers like haulers, food rescue organizations,
  technology platforms for prevention, composting facilities, and anaerobic digesters,
  and identify market niches and ideal customer types. Armed with that information,
  we then engage with businesses and institutions that have wasted food and actively
  connect them with the service providers that will provide the best solution. We
  take into account the location and size of the business, the type or amount of wasted
  food to be diverted, and associated costs. Once the businesses have this information,
  they can make an informed decision about how to reduce or divert their wasted food.

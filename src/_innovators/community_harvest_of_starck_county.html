description: 'Community Harvest was one of the first non-profit groups in our country to create a unique solution to hunger â€“ a solution that makes sense, is sustainable over time, and serves as a win-win for the community. We rescue fresh, healthy, prepared food and deliver it to the people and places serving the meals. There is no cost for the food, because it is all donated by area restaurants and food providers. Last year, Community Harvest rescued $1.5 Million in food and delivered approximately 950,000 meals to our hungry neighbors in Stark County.'

description: 'Share Meals is a free app designed to end hunger on college campuses. Our digital platform connects students to free food at events, fellow students with unused meal swipes, and other resources to sustainably elevate them out of food insecurity. With millions of college students forced to choose between adequate nutrition and educational expenses, the goal of Share Meals is to build community, end social isolation, and ensure that no student goes hungry. The digital platform is starting to be utilized in California and British Columbia.'

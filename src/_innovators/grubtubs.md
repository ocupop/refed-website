description: GrubTubs Inc. is dedicated to reconnecting communities with local family
  farms. Our job is to repurpose the food waste coming from restaurants and grocery
  stores into nutrient-rich animal feed that is affordable for the local farmer. By
  diverting waste from landfills and improving business economics for small farmers,
  we are disrupting an antiquated system that is keeping our country's food, energy,
  and waste cycles out of balance.

description: Hungry Harvest is on a mission to reduce food waste and fight hunger in the United States. We are a produce delivery service that recovers produce - fruits and vegetables that would normally go to waste for cosmetic or logistical reasons - from farms and wholesalers. We then triage, hand-package, and deliver these fruits and vegetables in variety boxes to customers'â€‹ homes at a discounted rate.

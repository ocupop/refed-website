description: Eat Greater Des Moines (EGDM) is a central Iowa-based non-profit organization
  that facilitates and builds connections to strengthen the area's food system. Through
  expanded partnerships, EGDM is bringing more healthy, edible unsellable food to
  organizations across central Iowa. Food recipients are not necessarily just hunger-fighting
  organizations. While Food Recipients are often food pantries and free meal sites,
  they are also after-school programs, housing communities and medical clinics. Our
  target recipients are those that are able to store rescued food safely and distribute
  to those in need. EGDM works to put food where the people are.

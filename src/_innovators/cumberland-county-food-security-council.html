  committed to initiating and facilitating collaborative action toward a just,
  resilient, and sustainable local and regional food system. Our mission is to
  ensure equitable access for all people to adequate, healthy food. The

  farmers and agencies that provide food to community members with limited
  resources. We mobilize volunteers to harvest, process and prepare fresh local
  food. Many of the volunteers are the community who benefit from the food.

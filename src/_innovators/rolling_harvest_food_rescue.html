description: "Since 2010, Rolling Harvest has been focused on partnering with local farmers, making it easy for them to share their fresh, healthy produce with the food-insecure communities in which they live. Our dedicated volunteers help with daily pick-up and delivery schedules from 35 farms and food producers, assist with weekly distributions to more than 50 hunger relief sites, and glean (harvest) directly from our farm partnersâ€™ fields.

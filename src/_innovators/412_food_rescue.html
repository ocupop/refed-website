description: '412 Food Rescue works with food providers to rescue un-sellable but perfectly good food. We utilize technology to efficiently match donors and beneficiaries, optimize food recovery operations and mobilize a last-mile transportation network to redirect food to nonprofits. Our mission is to launch programs and infrastructure that scale food recovery in urban regions. We also make value-added products: beer from bread, liqueur from gleaned fruit and others. In addition, we will soon be opening a commercial kitchen that will allow us to produce SNAP-eligible meals.'

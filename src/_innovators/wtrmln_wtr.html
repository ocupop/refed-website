description: "By creating this meaningful relationship with farmers, we were able to utilize these “discarded” melons to create what has already become one of the most exciting new beverages in the market. And in doing so, we were able to realize our collective dream of bringing a new and better product to the consumer, one that is of the highest standard from both a consumption and sustainability perspective."

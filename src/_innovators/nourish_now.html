description: Nourish Now works to alleviate food insecurity in Montgomery County, MD and beyond by reducing the waste of unused fresh food. Nourish Now strives to meet this goal by collecting surplus fresh food from our dedicated food donor partners throughout the Washington D.C. metro area. Food is then redistributed directly to families in need and to over 60 other Montgomery County, Maryland nonprofit organizations that provide food assistance to those in need.

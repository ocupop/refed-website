description: 'Normandy Waste Management Systems provides hardware and software solutions to track waste streams in commercial food production. The software enables customers to track waste streams by line, type and shift. Data is available (real-time) via a web-based login and offers access to volumes in the waste disposal container and historical data on servicing. Normandy WMS was created by a food by-product recycling company with over twenty years experience in the food manufacturing industry. This experience has given us a detailed knowledge of how much value is lost when ingredients are diverted from their primary market into the by-product market, as well as how deep food manufacturing waste costs can cut into a companyâ€™s profits.'

description: 'Healthy Food for all is a project of Madison Northside Planning Council and specializes in the recovery of bulk prepared foods from large cafeterias and events as well as produce from local farms. Prepared foods are brought to a commercial kitchen, repackaged into household size containers, labeled, and frozen. Produce is donated or field gleaned, cleaned, and aggregated in a commercial kitchen. All products are distributed at no charge directly to low income households or delivered to food pantries and other facilities where low income households congregate.'

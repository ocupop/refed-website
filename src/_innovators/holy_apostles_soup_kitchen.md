description: Holy Apostles Soup Kitchen is NYC's largest emergency food program with
  several outreach programs. Through our continued zero waste efforts, we've diverted
  25 tons of organic waste from landfills to compostable and renewable energy annually.  This
  past year we worked with the NYU Capstone Project to convert our paper drinking
  cups to reusable cups, and this was the first full year we separated and composted
  our garbage with city pickup. We have also partnered with the NYC Department of
  Sanitation to become a neighborhood drop-off site for compostable organic waste.

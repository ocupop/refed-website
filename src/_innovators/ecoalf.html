description: "ECOALF was created by Javier Goyeneche in 2012 to realise innovation in recycled clothing. But ECOALF is more than a conscious clothing brand; it is a mission to create the first generation of recycled products with the same attention to quality, design and technical properties as the best non-recycled products in the market. Current initiatives operate to manufacture discarded fishing nets, PET plastic bottles, used tyres, coffee, post industrial cottons and wool into high quality yarns and components for clothing, accessories and footwear."

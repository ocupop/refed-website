description: "For far too long, our society has ignored and disposed of billions of tons of valuable extra food. Within this food there is energy and nutrients that can be captured and reused. Full Circle Feed does just that!  Our treats are made with vegetables, meats, fruits, and breads from restaurant buffets that were prepared but not served. The result is a healthy, delicious, environmentally-sustainable dog treat!"

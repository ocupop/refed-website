description: Grubbly Farms was formed to combat the continuously rising cost of livestock feed by developing a sustainable source of protein. The increasing price of feed, which is the single largest expense of raising livestock, is causing undue hardships for farms of all sizes and running many farmers out of business.  Through the growth and processing of black soldier fly larvae, Grubbly Farms converts organic waste into high value and sustainable proteins, oils, and fertilizers.

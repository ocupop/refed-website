  From our humble beginnings in 1971 as a food-buying club to our current status
  as Southern Oregon’s first and only Certified Organic Retailer, over 11,000
  members strong, the Ashland Food Co-op has been connecting our community to
  healthy, local food for decades. Food waste is a big deal to us. We follow the
  EPA’s Food Recovery Hierarchy as a guide to bettering our own practices. 
   
   Imperfect produce is be used for vegetable stock, hot bar meals, or the salad bar. Staff will sort and reuse peaches, strawberries, bananas, and more for bakery goods, smoothies, and cold bar desserts. After resourcing useable food, staff are welcome to glean the excess. 
   
   Every evening, the Ashland Food Angels pick up the rest of the edible, healthy food. The Angels donate this food to the Ashland Emergency Food Bank, which provides emergency food supplies, without charge, to individuals and families in the Ashland/Talent area who would otherwise go hungry. 
   
  The pre-consumer food scraps are donated to a local farmer. He picks up
  several large barrels of food scraps every night to deliver as fodder to his
  goats, pigs, and cows. Deli and Produce staff collect these food scraps,
  making sure there are no rubber bands, paper wrapping, or metal twist ties
  that could injure the animals. Throughout 2018, over 50,000 gallons of food
  scraps were given to feed animals.

description: We are a young, fast-growing company developing the ResQ service, which allows consumers to "rescue"â€‹ valuable food at risk of going to waste, from e.g. restaurants, bakeries, cafes and hotels. The service was launched publicly in Finland during the first months of 2016 and has since expanded rapidly, both locally and to new cities and countries.

description: Gebni is a the worldâ€™s first food ordering platform applying real-time demand-adjusted pricing to restaurant take-out to sell food more efficiently and prevent excess inventory. This is done by creating more dynamic customer bases that would capture previously priced-out customers that are able to purchase meals at more affordable prices when demand is low. Gebni also allows users to pre-order meals up to 2 weeks in advance while giving them guaranteed discounts for such orders.

description: 'Transition Cafe is a not-for-profit enterprise which reduces food waste and saves carbon by stopping food going to landfill. Volunteers and staff collect perfectly good food that local businesses and people don’t want and would otherwise throw away, and turn it into affordable healthy meals and take-aways. The cafe menu changes regularly, depending on what food has been given, all the food is good to eat although some may be past its ‘best before’ date.'

  Commit to Green™ is a privately-owned American social enterprise that designs
  and manufactures compostable products. Our bags are 100% compostable. Unlike
  regular plastic bags, our bags are made from a resin derived from plants,
  vegetable oils and compostable polymers and can be consumed by micro-organisms
  that live in our soils. Because of this, they can be readily composted along
  with organic waste at municipal composting facilities. Our unique products
  help educate consumers on the importance of responsible waste management that
  greens our garbage and keeps our landfills’ growth in check.

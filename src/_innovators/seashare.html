  SeaShare partners with the seafood industry to bring seafood to food banks.
  This includes salmon and halibut bycatch from the Bering Sea and Gulf of
  alaska pollock fisheries. fishermen retain those fish for seashare to
  distribute across the U.S. for hunger relief. Additionally, seashare donates
  frozen and canned seafood that is near expiration date to food banks and
  feeding centers, rescuing it from disposal. each year Seashare distributes 2
  million pounds (8 million servings) of seafood to food banks in 25-30 states
  for those who are struggling with hunger.

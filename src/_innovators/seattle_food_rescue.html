description: Seattle Food Rescue is a 501c3 non-profit based in Seattle, Washington. We're working to improve nutritional access and health outcomes by redistributing otherwise wasted food directly to low income communities. Utilizing bikes to transport food enables food pick-up from smaller stores that are inaccessible to trucks.

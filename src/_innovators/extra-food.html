description: 'This NGO food recovery organization covers Marin County, CA. In 2.5 years, the staff and 160 volunteers have delivered 650,000 pounds of food from 145+ food donors to 72 sites across the county reaching 5,000+ people every month with food deliveries. Extra Food innovates by using a Salesforce database to coordinate food distribution by community volunteers, and through partnerships with local waste diversion agencies and organizations promoting food recovery for composting or digestion to recruit food donations first.'

  ExtraFood operates a free, nonprofit food recovery program in Marin County,
  CA. In 5 years, the staff and 600 volunteers have organized, rescued, and
  delivered 2,500,000 pounds of food from 225 food donors to 120 sites across

  ExtraFood innovates by using a Salesforce-based system for connecting

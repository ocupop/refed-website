description: "Each year the billions of coffee beans that eventually make their way into the Americanos, lattes, and cappuccinos of the world are harvested by milling and extracting them from the coffee plant. The surrounding fruit is discarded, often dumped into rivers or left to rot in heaps. So we invented something better to do with it. Something thatâ€™s better for everyone. For food & beverage companies, it is an all-natural, clean-label, nutrient-dense and distinctly flavorful ingredient as a sustainable found food.  "

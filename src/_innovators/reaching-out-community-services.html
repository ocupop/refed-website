  Reaching-Out Community Services leads the effort to eliminate hunger in our
  community and provide social services and programs that inspire self-reliance
  and community    
   empowerment in a dignified manner. Our Food Pantry: is a “Supermarket style Client-Choice” this enables our clients to select food items to fit their cultural, family preferences, and dietary needs.  We believe this arrangement is more dignified than pre-selecting the food and distributing it to the client The RCS food pantry also creates an environment in which the needy seniors, individuals, and families receives assistance with dignity.

description: "Eco-Safe DigesterÂ® is simple technology that eliminates food waste on-site. Since the digested food waste is converted into wastewater it is natural to use the municipal sewer systems to transport that water to wastewater treatment facilities where it will be recovered. There is no waste to store or transport, no residual solids to handle or manage, and no extra handling is required."

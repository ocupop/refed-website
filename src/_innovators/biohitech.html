  The Revolution Series and Eco-Safe DigesterÂ® are simple and cost-effective
  technologies that measure and eliminate food waste on-site. These cloud-based
  technology solutions provide a real-time data analytics tool for supply chain
  management and affect positive behavioral change to reduce food waste
  generation.  Since the digested food waste is converted into wastewater it is
  natural to use the municipal sewer systems to transport that water to
  wastewater treatment facilities where it will be recovered. There is no waste
  to store or transport, no residual solids to handle or manage, and no extra
  handling is required.

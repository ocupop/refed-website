  LUC is a full-scale composting solution that brings practical food scrap and
  organics collection systems to life for the home, enterprise and municipality.
  We have partnered with a local mulch producer to lovingly turn compostable
  material sourced from our customers and the community into nutrient-rich soil,
  which then enriches our local environment. Alongside curbside composting, we
  also sell compostable wares to local restaurants and businesses, fighting the
  spread of single-use plastics and encouraging our community to join the
  compost culture! We then help these businesses implement sustainability
  marketing plans to show off just how they are helping the environment and
  fighting food waste.

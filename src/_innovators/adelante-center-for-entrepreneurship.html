  Adelante Center creates wealth in distressed communities through living wage
  job creation, community development, and entrepreneurship.  We identify the
  most pressing needs in the distressed communities and identify how our network
  of partners can help create solutions to the issues.  If there is no
  organization leading the effort towards a solution, we create community based
  programs that fulfill the need and are scalable and self-sustaining.  The
  communities within a 5-10 mile radius of our office are over 66% low- to
  mid-income and 85% of the students qualify for free lunch.  In some areas,
  post-Covid unemployment is 40% or more.  Our solution of creating a virtual
  food pantry will not only create a marketplace to delivery food directly to
  food insecure families 7 days a week, but also manage inventory and direct
  donations and purchase from food banks, grocery stores, restaurants, and local
  farms who aren't plugged into the consumer distribution system that
  traditional food pantries employ.

description: Kromkommer is a social enterprise that aims to contribute to the reduction of food waste. About 10% of vegetables is wasted simply because they don't look good enough or because there is too much of it. Our goal is to get these veggies back on our plates. We tell the story of this beloved produce with creative campaigns and our own line of wonky vegetable soups.

description: "How long would you last sealed in a plastic bag or container without air or water? Not long right! Well, it's the same for all living things, therefore if you want your fruit & veggies to stay fresher for much longer, then you need to give them an environment they can thrive in. The Swag is a non-toxic, environmentally-friendly, sustainable, machine-washable, breathable bag, meaning fruit & veggies stay fresher for much longer - naturally. So, it's great for your health, your wallet and really good for the environment too! No more waste & no more toxic plastic!"

description: Friendship Donations Network rescues fresh, nutritious food that would otherwise be thrown away from stores and farms and redistributes it to neighbors in need. The organization also operate Neighborhood Food Hubs, which make donating garden produce easy!  A volunteer Hub Holder hosts a cooler on their front porch one day a week, which serves as the drop-off location for produce. The donations are distributed to food pantries, and when possible stay within the community where they are donated.

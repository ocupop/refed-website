description: 'Our vision is the “Fresh Index” – a real-time shelf life indicator to optimize the supply of food economically and ecologically. It is not printed but can be read out via an app and displayed digitally, e.g. on digital price tags and in online grocery stores. This keeps it dynamic: As long as the product is temperature-monitored, the index is updated automatically.'

  Willing Handsâ€™ mission is to recover food in order to reduce waste, improve
  health, and provide reliable access to nutritious food for our neighbors in
  need. Willing Hands distributes free, wholesome food to our neighbors in need.
  We pick up donated food, primarily fruits, and vegetables, that might
  otherwise go to waste. We deliver this food to local human service
  organizations and collaborate with them to provide nutritional education.

  Beautiful Portland serves over 1,000 meals a week to the Portland area
  homeless community and anyone in need. We are an organization of volunteers
  cooperating with other local nonprofits, food-gleaners, and volunteer groups
  working to distribute food that would be otherwise wasted in the Portland
  area. We have a team of volunteers who pick up, assemble, and deliver 100%
  mobile meals all over the local area. We are trying to create a culture of
  sustainable methods of food-sharing, in order to change things for the future.

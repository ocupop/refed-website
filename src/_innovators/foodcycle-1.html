  FoodCycle is working to leverage technology to create systemic change in our
  food systems by more effectively routing food and maintaining a data base of
  organizations that can use donated food. We collect excess food from
  businesses and deliver it to food banks and pantries that serve the food
  insecure in Los Angeles. We have created a successful outreach and education
  program that addresses the major obstacles to donating and are expanding to
  include information about food waste prevention in our outreach.

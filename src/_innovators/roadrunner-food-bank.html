  The leading hunger relief organization in New Mexico. As the largest food bank
  in the state, we play a major role in distributing a variety of donated and
  purchased food items to people struggling to cover all their nutritional
  needs. This commitment to hunger relief has been at the core of our work since
  our founding in 1979. Our food industry partners have helped make our work a
  reality by donating millions of pounds of food from across the country and
  right here in New Mexico year after year. In the last 10 years alone, rescued
  food products brought to our warehouse account for 170 million pounds of food
  â€“ all for the benefit of our hungry neighbors. This amazing resource has made
  141 million meals possible for low-income members of our community. Enter

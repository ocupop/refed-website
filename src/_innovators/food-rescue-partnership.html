  The Food Rescue Partnership is a coalition located in the Quad Cities
  (Iowa/Illinois border) that promotes rescuing food for its best possible use.
  The primary focus for rescuing food is through donation coordination, by
  establishing relationships between between potential donors and recipient
  agencies throughout the area to ensure excess food goes to feed people in need.
  Stakeholders provide education regarding how to get started in donating food,
  the policies that exist regarding liability and taxes, and contacts to match
  the donors with a recipient agency that can accept the type and quantity of
  food the donor has available. In addition, the food rescue partnership is
  working to learn about the additional options for inedible food (animal feed,
  composting, etc.) throughout the Quad Cities to ensure all food is being used
  as a resource and not ending up in the landfill.



  The Food Rescue Partnership operates in collaboration with the Riverbend Food
  Bank.

  At The River Fund New York, we regard food as the first line of defense in the
  battle against poverty: You cannot get through to a parent on any topic when
  that parentâ€™s child is hungry. Hence, moving people beyond the lines of
  poverty is completely impossible as long as hunger remains an immediate issue
  for them.

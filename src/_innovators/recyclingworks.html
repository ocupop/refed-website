  RecyclingWorks in Massachusetts (RecyclingWorks) is a recycling assistance
  program designed to help businesses and institutions maximize waste diversion
  opportunities. RecyclingWorks provides no-cost technical assistance, guidance
  documents, case studies, and more to help businesses succeed in starting or
  expanding any waste diversion program. Working across the EPA Food Recovery
  Hierarchy, RecyclingWorks connects businesses to solution providers to
  prevent, recover, and recycle wasted food. We also work with compost
  operations to help ensure well-operated sites by providing consulting advice
  on best management practices. RecyclingWorks is funded by the Massachusetts
  Department of Environmental Protection and administered by the Center for
  EcoTechnology.

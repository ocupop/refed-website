description: "In America, 50 million people struggle daily to find their next meal. This struggle is referred to as food insecurity. In stark contrast, over 1 billion meals are served at restaurants every week across the United States. With the TangoTab app, each time a person dines out, they could feed a person in need for no added cost. With these numbers, food insecurity can be a thing of the past."

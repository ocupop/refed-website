description: "MISFIT makes cold-pressed juice from MISFIT fruits and veggies&#58; produce that's perfectly good to eat but would get wasted otherwise because it's the wrong size, shape, or color to be sold at retail. In doing so, we're tackling the 6 billion pounds of produce that go unharvested or unsold every year in the U.S.â€”largely because of aesthetic standards."

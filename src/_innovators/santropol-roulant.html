description: 'The Roulantâ€™s rooftop garden is part intensive rooftop garden, part terrasse container garden. The real beauty of the garden is that it is one of the three pillars of our buildings food cycle. A portion of the food grown on the roof is sent to the kitchen for our meal-on-wheels. Kitchen scraps go down to the basement to be composted by our worms and finished compost is then brought back to up to the rooftop garden.'

  FEAST is dedicated to promoting wellness and enriching lives through the power
  of healthy foods and human connection. FEAST was created to help families
  struggling with the effects of living in a broken food system live healthier,
  more nourishing lives. We do that by providing a comprehensive 16-week
  wellness program that combines Food Education, Access to healthy foods, and
  group Support, Together. FEAST partners with community organizations
  (including Food Forward and Imperfect Produce) and food redistribution
  organizations to provide cooking classes and access to healthy food that would
  otherwise go to waste.

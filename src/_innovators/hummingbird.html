description: "A Hummingbird Urban Biomass facility diverts organic waste not used for composting, and converts it to fuel. Because we use source separated organics only, and not mixed municipal trash, the fuel can supply clean energy in the form of heat and/or electricity.  At the end of the process all that is left is a mineral rich ash that can be beneficially returned to the earth."

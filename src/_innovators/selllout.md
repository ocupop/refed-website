description: Selllout is an online marketplace for sellers and buyers of food that
  goes unsold, approaches "best by" dates, or reaches the end of daily business. These
  foods are sold to the public using a dutch style auction, meaning as time progresses,
  the food gets more and more affordable. Sellout's mission is to preserve that resource,
  and at the same time, feed our communities and help improve the environment.

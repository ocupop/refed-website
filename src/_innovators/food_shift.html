description: "Food Shift works with communities, businesses and government to shift behaviors toward a more sustainable use of food. Our programs increase awareness and action around food waste reduction; decrease the amount of edible food rotting in the landfill; and create jobs in the food recovery sector. Food Shift is more than a food recovery organization. We are shifting the problem of wasted food into a solution by developing sustainable solutions that address systemic issues behind food waste and hunger."

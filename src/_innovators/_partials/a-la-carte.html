  Joint Ventureâ€™s Silicon Valley Food Rescue is actively engaged in solutions
  for the efficient delivery of nutritious prepared food directly to those who
  need it most. With the Food Shift case study as a road map, Silicon Valley
  Food Rescue created a mobile food distribution model and named it A La Carte.
  An original concept, A La Carte is a fleet of trucks, staffed by trained
  personnel who gather prepared and packaged food from corporate and university
  campuses for delivery directly into neighborhoods with high-density
  populations of people in need. A La Carte offers a no-cost, convenient, and
  dignified experience for recipients. Drivers are food-safety trained and
  trucks are refrigerated.

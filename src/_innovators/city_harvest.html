  City Harvest pioneered food rescue in 1982 and, this year, will collect 55
  million pounds of excess food to help feed the nearly 1.4 million New Yorkers
  struggling to put meals on their tables. City Harvest exists to end hunger in
  communities across New York City through food rescue. Since our founding in
  1982, we have been fighting food waste by collecting excess food, with a focus
  on fresh produce, from all sectors of the food industry, and delivering it
  free of charge to over 400 community food distribution programs. To date, our
  organization has diverted over 700 million pounds of rescued food from
  landfills and redistributed this healthy food to combat hunger. City Harvest
  is now New York Cityâ€™s largest food rescue organization, helping to feed the
  nearly 1.2 million food insecure New Yorkers.

  PurePlus+ is created from up-cycled fruits and vegetables to create a plant
  based powder for companies to add to their products for a nutrient boost.
  Fruits and vegetables are the most wasted product and have the highest climate
  impact. We can minimize environmental impact by putting all these plus fruits
  and vegetables to use by extracting their vitamins and nutrients.


  PurePlus+  will make perishable fruits and vegetables last longer, boost the
  efficacy of vitamins and use fewer natural resources.  PurePlus+  easily
  integrates into a range of food products - beverages, superfood blends,
  nutrition bars, baking products.  The PurePlus+ Color Line replaces
  multivitamins directly to the consumer because whole fruits and vegetables
  contain many other ingredients that boost the efficacy of vitamins.  


  Our mission is to make organic fruit and vegetable powder that is good for the
  health of the people and planet.

  We measure ourselves in the reduction of fruit and vegetable waste and
  micronutrient deficiencies by the products we create.  We divert fruit and
  vegetable waste to reduce environmental impact and cost. Food solutions are
  more powerful then energy in reversing global warming.  Don't let anything go
  to waste - Illuminating the power of food to restore the health of people and
  the planet.

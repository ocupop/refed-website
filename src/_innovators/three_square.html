description: "The Food Rescue Program enables our Program Partners to provide their clients with perishable foods, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy and bakery products that are close to code. Each weekday Three Square drivers in refrigerated trucks visit local grocery and retail stores to pick up those items. They are then delivered directly to an Agency Partner facility where the food is distributed within 24-48 hours or brought back to our warehouse for placement in the Agency Store. "

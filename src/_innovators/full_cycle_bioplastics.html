description: "Full Cycle Bioplastics (FCB) has developed a profitable and eco-friendly waste to bioplastic conversion technology in a scalable platform. FCBâ€™s proprietary biotechnology process can convert a full range of organic waste materials into polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), a high performance biodegradable substitute for petroleum-based plastics. This bioplastic resin can be manufactured into finished goods that, upon reaching the end of their useful life, can be reintroduced back into our system and reformed anew repeatedly."

description: "In FoPo, we collect fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be wasted (because they are ugly or too ripe) and turn them into dried powder, prolonging shelf-life from 2 weeks to about 2 years. That way, we maximize logistics by transporting compact-friendly powders while also preserving nutrients by up to 90%."

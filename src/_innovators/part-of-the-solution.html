  POTS’ mosaic of services, big and small, simple and complex, come together in
  its ‘one-stop shop’ model. Offering a wide array of support under one roof,
  staff and services work in concert to address diverse and complex needs. When
  POTS does not directly provide a needed service, staff link clients with peer
  organizations to ensure every individual receives the help he or she needs.

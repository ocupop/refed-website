  Quantalux has extensive technical expertise in the co-digestion of in edible
  food waste at wastewater treatment plants and farms with anaerobic digesters.
  We help the operators of these facilities manage and balance the internal
  biochemistry of their anaerobic digester when food waste is combined with
  sewage sludge or manure. Co-digestion is a sustainable approach for converting
  inedible food waste into biogas for renewable energy production. Our clients
  include investment groups, universities and municipalities.

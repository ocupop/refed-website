description: "Bridging the gap between waste and want since 1981. Food For Free rescues fresh food (food that might otherwise go to waste) and distributes it within the local emergency food system where it can reach those in need. Launched in the spring of 2016, our Family Meals program re-purposes prepared foods into single-serving meals for people with limited access to kitchens. Family Meals uses surplus foods from university dining halls and other sources, rescued via our Prepared Foods Rescue program."

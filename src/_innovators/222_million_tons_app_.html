description: No one wants to waste food, but how does one person get through a bunch of celery before it goes limp without getting sick of celery? It was that question which inspired us to develop the 222 million tons platform for the iPad, and to start developing one-week menus and shopping lists that allow single people, couples and small families to enjoy variety in their diets, without wasting fresh food.

description: In 2009, Danny started hauling compostable waste in addition to recycling and trash, and in 2012 started a compost processing facility to to help divert large volumes of materials from area landfills while also creating a quality by-product of finished compost and topsoil. To reflect these changes, the business motto evolved into, "Danny's Dumpster - Reducing Waste, Renewing Resources".

description: "We are on a mission to eliminate food waste on organic banana farms. When bananas have scuffs, are a little too ripe, or arenâ€™t the perfect size - they are rejected for export. We upcycle these &quot;imperfect&quot; organic bananas that used to be wasted at these farms and turn them into Barnana instead of letting these tasty morsels go to waste."

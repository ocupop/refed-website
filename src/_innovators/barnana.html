description: We are on a mission to eliminate food waste on organic banana farms. When bananas have scuffs, are a little too ripe, or arenâ€™t the perfect size - they are rejected for export. We upcycle these "imperfect" organic bananas that used to be wasted at these farms and turn them into Barnana instead of letting these tasty morsels go to waste.

description: "This incredible public-private partnership is recycling organic waste in Tucson, AZ through a first of its kind collaborative model between the University of Arizona, City of Tucson, and Tohono O'odham Nation. This project was started by students at the U of A in 2011, and has since grown to become the first commercial organic waste collection service in Tucson. In 5 years, they successfully diverted over 10 million pounds of organic waste from entering local landfills in Tucson."

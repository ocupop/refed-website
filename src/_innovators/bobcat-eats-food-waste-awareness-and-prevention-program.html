  The Bobcat Eats Food Waste Awareness and Prevention Program is a collaboration
  between the University of California, Merced and the Merced County Food Bank
  with the goals to reduce food insecurity and food waste in the County. One
  component is harvesting or gleaning food from Merced County farms, backyards
  and other food outlets. Anyone with surplus food or who wants to volunteer can
  register here: mercedgleaning.org. The second component involves distributing
  more food to those in need. If your community organization or non-profit is
  interested in picking up free food from the Food Bank, please contact
  emeyer4@ucmerced.edu.

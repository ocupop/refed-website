  Our mission is to provide food to people in need, improve the environment, and
  make business more profitable through food sustainability.
   
  To accomplish this, we're creating a Zero Food Waste certification program
  that includes consulting and support from source reduction through recycling
  and recovery. We believe we can reduce operating costs, increase tax breaks,
  and boost sales for participating businesses. This earned revenue model will
  allow us to scale free food recovery across the country for those interested
  in donating only. 
   
  We'll be targeting recipients that use food to get people in their doors ton
  the path towards great long-term outcomes focused on jobs, housing, and
  healthcare.

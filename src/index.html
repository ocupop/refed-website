      <p>Around the world, food loss and waste is responsible for more than 8%
      of greenhouse gas emissions. In the U.S., uneaten food consumes
      approximately 20% of cropland and fresh water &ndash; and it&rsquo;s the
      number one product entering landfills.</p>

      <p>A huge portion of surplus food could go to help those in need.
      Meanwhile, the number of people lacking reliable access to sufficient,
      affordable, and nutritious food grew to more than 50 million in 2020 due
      to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

      <p>Each year, the country lets food worth nearly $400 billion go uneaten.
      While consumers pay a large portion of this, the cost to the food industry
      is $240B, with foodservice businesses like restaurants bearing the
      brunt.</p>

          <p>Each year in the United States, 36% of food produced &ndash; 92.8 million tons &ndash; is never eaten. While this has enormous impacts on our environment, food insecurity, the economy, and more, many businesses, jurisdictions, nonprofits, funders, and others are already making a substantial impact to address the challenge. But much more needs to be done to achieve national and international goals to reduce food loss and waste by 50% by the year 2030.</p>
          <p>Based on an extensive analysis of public and proprietary data from across the entire food system, ReFED estimates that we can achieve a reduction in food waste of 43 million tons, deliver $109 billion in net economic benefit for the country each year, avoid 70 million tons of GHGs, rescue <strong>AA meals</strong>, create 64,000 jobs &ndash; <em>and</em> achieve our 2030 reduction goal &ndash; by investing $18 billion per year over the next ten years to implement food waste prevention, rescue, and recycling solutions.</p>

          Food waste is a systemwide problem, and solving it will require a systemwide response. Our <em>Roadmap to 2030: Reducing U.S. Food Waste</em> looks at the entire food supply chain and identifies seven key action areas to help guide the food system&rsquo;s efforts over the next ten years. In line with the Target-Measure-Act framework for food waste reduction that&rsquo;s been adopted around the world, the <em>Roadmap to 2030</em> is a critical blueprint to move the food system to action.

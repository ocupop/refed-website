    title: The Multi-Billion Dollar Food Waste Problem
    description_html: >-
      <p>52 million tons of food sent to landfill annually, plus another 10
      million tons that is discarded or left unharvested on farms. If all of our
      country&rsquo;s uneaten food was grown in one place, this
      &ldquo;mega-farm&rdquo; would cover roughly 80 million acres, over
      three-quarters of the entire state of California &ndash; all for food that
      is never eaten.</p>

      “The ReFED team has been an incredible strategic partner in our journey to
      end hunger and waste. ReFED’s insights and guidance helped shape the
      strategy of The Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation’s
      Innovation Fund and its open call for innovative solutions. Kroger values
      ReFED’s deep knowledge and leadership in food waste reduction, and we’ve
      never been more excited and hopeful that together we can truly change our
      food system.”

            For us, success is a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food system that allows the planet, people and the economy

            the best use of the food we grow.

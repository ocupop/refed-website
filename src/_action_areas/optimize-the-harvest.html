  <p>Avoid over-production, then harvest as much as possible. For wild-caught
  products, source only what is needed.</p>
description_html: >-
  <p>Of the nearly 24 million tons of surplus food generated at the farm level,
  a staggering 87% accounts for produce that reached maturity but was left
  behind after harvest. Some of this is considered inedible for reasons
  including rot and insect infestation (although it still could potentially be
  used for non-food purposes), but more than a third of the surplus is left
  behind, because it&rsquo;s considered &ldquo;not marketable&rdquo; &ndash;
  frequently because of overly strict quality or appearance standards
  established by stakeholders further down the supply chain. And surprisingly,
  another third of what&rsquo;s left behind <em>is</em> actually considered
  marketable, but it isn&rsquo;t harvested for other reasons, including
  insufficient labor to harvest or planned surplus for contracts that have
  already been fulfilled for the season.&nbsp;</p><p>Optimizing the harvest
  means aligning what is grown with what is ultimately harvested, by avoiding
  overproduction and then harvesting as much as possible. When it comes to
  wild-caught products, such as fish, some animals, and certain types of
  produce, it means sourcing only what is needed. Solutions in this action area
  include finding new ways to sell and donate what&rsquo;s left after harvest,
  such as developing innovative contract structures that don&rsquo;t incentivize
  overproduction, and improving systems of communication that relay forecasted
  demands back up the supply chain to producers. Additionally, technological
  innovations that streamline individual, cross-sector, and cross-supply chain
  data-sharing could amplify the benefits. While these solutions manifest in
  less waste at production, the opportunities and responsibility to implement
  them lie across all supply chain actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly half of the
  capital investments needed for solution adoption in this action area come from
  Corporate Finance and Spending, where the companies and organizations that
  invest in development and implementation of the solutions will receive the
  greatest benefit. The next largest contributions are equally split among
  Impact-First Investments, Venture Capital, and Private Equity, highlighting
  the need for catalytic capital from philanthropic and private investors to
  increase participation from all types of funders.</p>

    <ul><li><strong>Unlock Returns with For-Profit Internal Capital -
    </strong>These solutions will be unlocked through funding by internal
    capital from for-profit organizations (Corporate Finance and Spending), as
    they generate additional revenue opportunities and financial returns for the
    implementers.</li><li><strong>Public Funding Fulfills Various Capacities -
    </strong>Government grants can play a key role in financially supporting
    smaller food organizations and innovators. Additionally, grants can assist
    with pilot programs to incentivize food businesses in adoption. Program
    specific government grant funding can aid in the ongoing costs of gleaning
    organizations.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Expand Farm to Food Bank Programs </strong>&ndash; [Federal;
    Legislative] To reduce the financial barrier of farmers donating food,
    governments can set aside funds to cover the harvesting, processing,
    packaging, and transportation costs of donating agricultural products to
    food banks. Federally, Congress could continue the Farm to Food Bank Program
    (FTFB), authorized for $4 million/year in the 2018 Farm Bill as part of the
    Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP),&nbsp; increase the funding for
    the program, and waive the state fund matching requirement. States can look
    to the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System (PASS) as a
    model.</li><li><strong>Alternative Tax Credits for Food Donation by
    Farmers</strong> &ndash; [Federal, State; Legislative] The existing federal
    enhanced tax deduction for food donations is not well-suited to farmers and
    often is not claimed by them, as many farmers operate at low profit margins
    and do not make enough income to claim a tax deduction. Further, the
    calculation of the value of the deduction is very onerous for farmers. To
    incentivize farmers to donate their surplus food and offset some of the
    costs of donation, Congress could provide an alternative tax credit for
    farmers instead of the existing enhanced deduction. States can also enact
    state-level tax credits for food donation, as exist already in about a dozen
    states.</li><li><strong>Funding for Temperature-Controlled Food Distribution
    Infrastructure </strong>&ndash; [Federal, State; Legislative] Lack of cold
    storage and transportation is a limiting factor for donation of perishables.
    Congress or state legislatures could provide funding for
    temperature-controlled food distribution infrastructure (e.g. refrigeration
    warehouses, temperature-controlled packaging and transportation) to handle
    additional food donation volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Funding for
    Further Farm-Level Research </strong>&ndash; [Federal; Legislative &amp;
    Regulatory] There is so much still to learn about food loss at the farm
    level. USDA could conduct studies to quantify and characterize farm-level
    losses on a semi-regular basis. This could be done through Congress
    providing funding in the next Farm Bill, or USDA leadership commissioning
    ERS directly to conduct such studies.</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Enable Buyer-Grower Relationships</strong> - Rather than
    regularly changing, if buyers keep staff in positions longer, this will
    enable stronger buyer-grower relationships that facilitate reciprocity
    within business, stimulate creative purchasing dynamics, and build
    trust.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Share Demand Information</strong>- Increased
    sharing of demand forecasts can help producers plant accordingly and
    ultimately reduce overproduction.</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior
    Change</strong> - Producers should participate in pilot research programs,
    data collection campaigns, and other collective efforts to improve food
    utilization best practices, waste reduction strategies, and food management
    skills.</li><li><strong>Diversify Harvest Partners </strong>- Producers
    should develop and strengthen relationships with alternative harvesting
    resources, such as gleaning networks or &ldquo;Pick and Pack Out&rdquo;
    programs, to minimize wasted product.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Grower-Buyer Contracts - </strong>New grower-buyer contract
    models are needed to disincentivize overproduction and encourage full
    utilization of produce on farms, such as is done with whole field purchasing
    agreements.</li><li><strong>New Approaches to Labor</strong> - Farm labor
    contract models and/or harvest mechanization are needed to address farm
    labor shortages and the complexities of third-party labor contractors, which
    can at times lead growers to leave product
    unharvested.</li><li><strong>Digital Planting Coordination -</strong>
    Digital agriculture technologies are needed to capture, store, and share
    data in order to support coordination with other growers and inform
    demand-driven production adjustments, which can lead to less
    overproduction.</li></ul>

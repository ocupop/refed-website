    - label: Improved Communication for Planting Schedules
      summary: >-
        Technology-enabled coordination between producers to minimize surplus
        planting and to match future harvest quantities with projected market
        demand.
    - label: Sanitation Practices & Monitoring
      summary: >-
        Practices and oversight that can reduce contamination, microbial growth,
        pests, and other food safety concerns, which would otherwise lead to
        waste and disposal.
    - label: Optimized Harvesting Schedules
      summary: >-
        Coordinated harvest planning that integrates weather patterns,
        demand-forecasting, and growing timelines to maximize product quality
        and shelf life.
    - label: On-Farm/Near-Farm Processing
      summary: >-
        Immediate post-harvest processing, such as freezing, drying, jamming, or
        other, to leverage freshness of products, reduce waste of surplus or
        damaged goods, and/or minimize transportation costs.
    - label: Local Food Systems
      summary: >-
        Collaborative network in which food is locally produced, processed,
        distributed, consumed, and recycled to support the health and wellness
        of the community and environment.
    - label: Clear Product Ownership
      summary: >-
        Defined responsibility for maintaining quality, minimizing losses, and
        ensuring successful transition of product as it passes hands over the
        course of the supply chain.

    <ul><li><strong>Unlock Returns with For-Profit Internal Capital -
    </strong>These solutions will be unlocked through funding by internal
    capital from for-profit organizations (Corporate Finance and Spending), as
    they generate additional revenue opportunities and financial returns for the
    implementers.</li><li><strong>Public Funding Fulfills Various Capacities -
    </strong>Government grants can play a key role in financially supporting
    smaller food organizations and innovators. Additionally, grants can assist
    with pilot programs to incentivize food businesses in adoption. Program
    specific government grant funding can aid in the ongoing costs of gleaning
    organizations.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Expand Farm to Food Bank Programs </strong>&ndash; [Federal;
    Legislative] To reduce the financial barrier of farmers donating food,
    governments can set aside funds to cover the harvesting, processing,
    packaging, and transportation costs of donating agricultural products to
    food banks. Federally, Congress could continue the Farm to Food Bank Program
    (FTFB), authorized for $4 million/year in the 2018 Farm Bill as part of the
    Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP),&nbsp; increase the funding for
    the program, and waive the state fund matching requirement. States can look
    to the Pennsylvania Agricultural Surplus System (PASS) as a
    model.</li><li><strong>Alternative Tax Credits for Food Donation by
    Farmers</strong> &ndash; [Federal, State; Legislative] The existing federal
    enhanced tax deduction for food donations is not well-suited to farmers and
    often is not claimed by them, as many farmers operate at low profit margins
    and do not make enough income to claim a tax deduction. Further, the
    calculation of the value of the deduction is very onerous for farmers. To
    incentivize farmers to donate their surplus food and offset some of the
    costs of donation, Congress could provide an alternative tax credit for
    farmers instead of the existing enhanced deduction. States can also enact
    state-level tax credits for food donation, as exist already in about a dozen
    states.</li><li><strong>Funding for Temperature-Controlled Food Distribution
    Infrastructure </strong>&ndash; [Federal, State; Legislative] Lack of cold
    storage and transportation is a limiting factor for donation of perishables.
    Congress or state legislatures could provide funding for
    temperature-controlled food distribution infrastructure (e.g. refrigeration
    warehouses, temperature-controlled packaging and transportation) to handle
    additional food donation volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Funding for
    Further Farm-Level Research </strong>&ndash; [Federal; Legislative &amp;
    Regulatory] There is so much still to learn about food loss at the farm
    level. USDA could conduct studies to quantify and characterize farm-level
    losses on a semi-regular basis. This could be done through Congress
    providing funding in the next Farm Bill, or USDA leadership commissioning
    ERS directly to conduct such studies.</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Grower-Buyer Contracts - </strong>New grower-buyer contract
    models are needed to disincentivize overproduction and encourage full
    utilization of produce on farms, such as is done with whole field purchasing
    agreements.</li><li><strong>New Approaches to Labor</strong> - Farm labor
    contract models and/or harvest mechanization are needed to address farm
    labor shortages and the complexities of third-party labor contractors, which
    can at times lead growers to leave product
    unharvested.</li><li><strong>Digital Planting Coordination -</strong>
    Digital agriculture technologies are needed to capture, store, and share
    data in order to support coordination with other growers and inform
    demand-driven production adjustments, which can lead to less
    overproduction.</li></ul>

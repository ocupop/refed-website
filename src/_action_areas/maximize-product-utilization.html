    <ul><li><strong>Operational Changes Require Corporate Capital</strong> -
    These solutions are corporate decisions with a likelihood to result in net
    economic benefit; therefore investment in this action area would be most
    appropriate in the form of Corporate Finance and Spending. Corporations have
    shown recent interest in these solutions as an opportunity to innovate
    product development. As solutions, such as Upcycling, continue to develop as
    a category, it may attract strategic acquisitions from solutions
    adopters.</li><li><strong>Private Equity and Venture Capital Align with
    Needs for Technology-Based Solutions - </strong>High-capital expenditure
    solutions (high upfront) require an interesting mix of investors, primarily
    Private Equity, which would find the hard assets appealing due to the
    ability to finance with debt. Venture Capital theoretically could be
    interested in these types of organizations should there be more
    technology-enabled business models (e.g., software-guiding manufacturing
    line optimization).</li><li><strong>Public and Private Funds for Innovative
    Packaging and Processing - </strong>Although <em>Active &amp; Intelligent
    Packaging</em> and <em>Manufacturing Line Optimization</em> are perceived to
    be mature, continued innovation relating to product upcycling and packaging
    materials still needs to occur. These business models are most appropriately
    financed with venture capital and research grants.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Support Research and Development of Upcycled Foods -
    </strong>[Federal, State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] Creating new food
    products out of what are currently byproducts can require significant
    research and development for both the products themselves as well as the
    equipment to create them. Federal, state, and local governments can provide
    grants for testing out new technologies, procedures or techniques to utilize
    upcycled ingredients, and marketing and supply chain
    needs.</li><li><strong>Require Standardized Date Labels</strong> - [Federal,
    State; Legislative, Regulatory] Voluntary initiatives in the U.S. have
    coalesced around &ldquo;BEST if Used By&rdquo; as the term for date labels
    indicating food&rsquo;s peak quality and &ldquo;USE By&rdquo; for labels
    intended to indicate safety. This standardization only works, however, if
    there is full adoption across the industry. To ensure that occurs, Congress
    (or state governments) could require standardization by limiting date
    labeling language on all products to those two options. In addition,
    governments could expressly permit the donation of food after the peak
    quality date and promote consumer education and awareness on the meaning of
    date labels.</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Upcycling R&amp;D - </strong>Dedicated research and
    development is needed for upcycling of more byproducts and unused food
    streams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Instant Pathogen Testing -
    </strong>Low-cost instant pathogen testing is needed to enable businesses to
    directly evaluate the safety of their food, ultimately moving away from
    broad rules that require food to be discarded according to generic regulated
    time and temperature food safety protocols.</li><li><strong>Adaptable
    Packaging - </strong>Flexible packaging solutions that enable
    transferability between supply chains are needed, so that food that
    can&rsquo;t be sold to food service could instead be sold into retail, and
    vice versa.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong>Government to Invest Long-Term in Consumer Education -
    </strong>Despite this being one of the most impactful action areas to fight
    food waste, the associated solutions can be harder to fund from more
    traditional sources of capital, since the return on investment is mostly
    derived from societal good and lacks direct financial return. Especially for
    those solutions that drive the most impact but require a significant
    investment to work effectively at changing behaviors, government sources may
    be the most appropriate capital provider.</li><li><strong>Corporate Funding
    Supports Strategy and Branding Push - </strong>A number of solutions in this
    action area are expected to be mostly financed through corporate finance,
    given that they require corporate decisions with potential financial
    benefits. Even a national, government-funded consumer education program can
    benefit from support from private stakeholders such as food businesses to
    help increase awareness, offer strategies for food waste reduction, and
    promote a culture of active waste avoidance. Corporations will not
    necessarily be viewing this type of spending from a return on investment
    perspective, but rather as a broad ESG or CSR strategy and/or
    brand/reputation building.</li><li><strong>Philanthropic Funding Aids Small
    to Medium Sized Food Businesses - </strong>To aid in adoption of solutions
    for small to medium-sized businesses (e.g., restaurants), Impact-First
    Investors, Non-Government Grants, and Local Government Grants can cover the
    upfront costs and incentive solutions like <em>Trayless Dining </em>systems
    and training.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Fund or Implement Consumer Education Campaigns -
    </strong>[Federal, State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] Households are the
    biggest source of food waste in the U.S., yet American consumers perceive
    themselves as wasting little, with nearly three-quarters reporting that they
    discard less food than the average American. Given this lack of awareness,
    education campaigns on food waste are critical. Rather than creating
    multiple campaigns, the federal government could create a single campaign
    that can be used by state and local governments, businesses, and community
    organizations so that consumers receive the same message from multiple
    channels.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Support Food Waste Reduction and Recovery
    Programs in Schools- </strong>[Federal, State, Local; Legislative,
    Regulatory] Schools could implement food waste and recovery measures with
    funding for food storage facilities, on-site composting facilities, share
    tables, the administration of food donation programs, and educational
    programming. Federal, state, or local governments could award grants on a
    competitive basis to schools to implement such
    reforms.</li><li><strong>Implement School Lunch Changes - </strong>[Federal,
    State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] A few changes to the format of school
    meal programs are proven to lead to more food being eaten, and thus less
    food going to waste during school meals. Longer lunch periods provide
    students enough time to select and eat their meals and thus waste less food.
    Shifting lunch time to occur after recess has been shown to increase the
    likelihood of students making healthier choices and reducing food waste by
    30%. The Offer Versus Serve (OVS) meal reimbursement model decreases waste
    by not forcing students to take items they do not plan to eat. Under USDA
    regulations, OVS is optional in elementary and middle schools, but required
    in high schools. The federal government, state, or local governments can
    reduce plate waste by incentivizing schools to implement OVS for all
    grade-levels and mandating longer lunch periods and recess before
    lunch.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Require Standardized Date Labels</strong> -
    [Federal, State; Legislative, Regulatory] Voluntary initiatives in the U.S.
    have coalesced around &ldquo;BEST if Used By&rdquo; as the term for date
    labels indicating food&rsquo;s peak quality and &ldquo;USE By&rdquo; for
    labels intended to indicate safety. This standardization only works,
    however, if there is full adoption across the industry. To ensure that
    occurs, Congress (or state governments) could require standardization by
    limiting date labeling language on all products to those two options. In
    addition, governments could expressly permit the donation of food after the
    peak quality date and promote consumer education and awareness on the
    meaning of date labels.</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Online Shopping Assistance - </strong>Online shopping
    features that provide real-time assistance with meal planning, food storage,
    and other positive behaviors are needed to encourage better in-home food
    management.</li><li><strong>In-Store Assistance - </strong>Evolutions within
    the in-store shopping experience are needed to disincentivize
    over-purchasing and provide customer support for improved in-home food
    management.</li><li><strong>Kitchen Tech and Internet of Things (IoT) -
    </strong>Kitchen technology is needed to improve inventory management and
    full product utilization in home, including smaller, smarter refrigerators
    and IoT devices that can help people manage and use all of their food before
    it spoils.</li></ul>

    <ul><li><strong>Operational Changes Require Corporate Capital
    </strong>-<strong> </strong>Operational changes such as intelligent routing,
    temperature monitoring and decreased transit time will require
    corporations&rsquo; internal capital to purchase and implement these
    solutions, and change behaviors of employees through training and
    incentives.</li><li><strong>Private Investments Drive Effectiveness and
    Reduces Costs, Supporting Solution Adoption</strong> - Venture capital and
    corporate R&amp;D drive greater effectiveness and decrease costs for
    distribution technologies and solutions, which encourages their adoption in
    both large and small organizations. We have already been seeing lower costs
    for environmentally friendly sensors, increasing accessibility for various
    temperature monitoring solutions. Additionally, as consolidation occurs in
    technology-enabled solution providers and winners emerge, Private Equity can
    help scale these solutions with growth capital.</li><li><strong>Public Funds
    Increase Accessibility and Support Societal Good</strong> - Impact First
    Investors, Government, and Non-Government Organizations have a significant
    role to play in filling in the gaps not addressed by other capital types.
    Perceived risk is reduced by providing capital help organizations to run
    pilot programs to make distribution efforts more efficient &ndash; thereby
    giving these businesses the opportunity to understand the ROI before
    financing themselves.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Encourage Crop Preservation and Post-Harvest Loss Prevention
    Technologies </strong>&ndash; [Federal; Legislative and Regulatory] To
    increase support for innovations that reduce food loss, USDA could give
    preference to projects that address issues of crop preservation or
    post-harvest loss prevention in the Specialty Crop Research Initiative
    (SCRI) and/or other grant programs. This could be done directly by USDA or
    through the direction of Congress.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fund
    Spoilage-Inhibiting Technologies </strong>&ndash; [Federal; Legislative or
    Regulatory] Similar to the Specialty Crop Research Initiative (SCRI), there
    is a need for a funding mechanism that focuses exclusively on providing
    support for research and development of new technologies that demonstrate
    effectiveness in loss prevention of dairy, meat, poultry, and fish. To do
    this, Congress could create a program, possibly in the next Farm
    Bill.&nbsp;</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Supply Chain Data Integration -</strong> Continued data
    integration into logistics is needed to improve supply chain visibility of
    freshness and temperature exposure, ultimately allowing for smarter product
    usage decisions according to shelf life.</li><li><strong>New Infrastructure
    Solutions - </strong>Creative infrastructure solutions, such as
    micro-fulfillment centers and convertible spaces, would help to minimize
    on-hand inventory and reduce last-mile time and
    costs.</li><li><strong>Processing and Handling Tech - </strong>Improved
    mechanized and automated processing capabilities across supply chains can
    optimize product handling.</li><li><strong>Coordinate Idle Assets -
    </strong>Via optimized coordination systems and technologies that will
    bolster relationships between food businesses to fully leverage idle cold
    storage and transportation assets, streamlining communications, and
    increasing access when needed.</li></ul>

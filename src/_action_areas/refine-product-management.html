      summary: >-
        Inventory evaluation to compare historic sales, costs of stocking and
        storing versus the benefit of selling in order to decrease variety of
        products to what is most profitable.

        Inventory management technique, often using technology, to decrease
        prices for items that are falling behind average rate of sale in order

  financing_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Operational Changes Require Corporate Capital -
    </strong>Operational changes, such as decreased transit time and
    First-Expired/First-Out models, will require corporations&rsquo; internal
    capital to purchase enabling equipment, pay service fees for solution
    providers, and change behaviors of employees through training and
    incentives</li><li><strong>Philanthropic Funding Decreases Risk for Food
    Businesses - </strong>Impact-First Investors, Government, and Non-Government
    organizations have a significant role to play in supporting solution
    adoption in food organizations and nonprofits, particularly for subsidizing
    the upfront costs associated with implementing supplier- and
    purchaser-specific solutions. Depending on the size and capacity of some
    food businesses, implementing certain solutions can add operational risk and
    strain the organizational bandwidth. Philanthropic funding can act as a
    buffer for these organizations to limit the risk of non-starter solutions.
    De-risking funding is not a silver bullet by any means, but it can start the
    conversation for adopters.</li><li><strong>Private Investments Drive
    Effectiveness and Reduce Costs, Supporting Solution Adoption -
    </strong>Venture capital and corporate R&amp;D drive greater effectiveness
    and decrease costs for product management technologies and solutions, which
    encourages adoption in large and small organizations.&nbsp;</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Disincentivize, Limit, or Ban Food from
    Landfills&ndash;</strong> [State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] Organic
    waste bans prohibit food waste from being sent to landfills, which in turn
    compels any business or other organization subject to the law (there are
    sometimes thresholds) to reduce their food waste. Organic waste bans are one
    of the most powerful ways to not only require recovery or recycling, but
    also incentivize preventative measures and food donations while also
    enabling measurement. Seven states currently have laws of this nature, as do
    several cities. Alternatively, while not as strong, increasing landfill
    tipping fees can achieve some of the same results by disincentivizing waste
    overall.</li><li><strong>Eliminate Tax Deduction for Edible Food Discards -
    </strong>[Federal; Legislative, Regulatory] Businesses currently deduct the
    value of discarded food from their taxable income, which is often more
    lucrative than donating the food. Removing this deduction would
    disincentivize over-purchasing and encourage food donation without
    additional cost to the government. Congress could examine revise tax laws to
    limit or remove this deduction.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Incentivize
    Innovations that Reduce Food Waste - </strong>[Federal, State, Local;
    Legislative/Regulatory] To spur adoption of existing technologies and
    encourage innovation of new ones, rebates, tax deductions, or other
    incentives could be granted to businesses that employ technologies that
    demonstrate an ability to reduce food waste by at least 10%.&nbsp;</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Cost-Efficient Tech - </strong>Research and development are
    needed to drive cost reductions of smart labeling, temperature monitoring,
    and early spoilage detection. These technologies exist but have not reached
    a price that allows for true scale.</li><li><strong>Automated Waste Tracking
    - </strong>Further automation in waste tracking and measurement, including
    that enabled by machine learning, image recognition, and "hands-free"
    tracking technologies, is needed to significantly increase measurement and
    the resulting management that comes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Advanced Ordering
    - </strong>Platforms that encourage advanced consumer orders are needed, as
    these provide businesses the ability to forecast with more
    precision.&nbsp;</li></ul>

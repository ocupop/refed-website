    <ul><li><strong>Philanthropic Funding Moves &ldquo;Trapped&rdquo; Food
    Through the Supply Chain</strong> - The lifeblood of food rescue should
    continue to remain philanthropic funding in the form of non-government
    grants and market subsidies in the form of tax incentives; this will aid in
    the sourcing of &ldquo;trapped&rdquo; food at various food organizations
    across the supply chain.</li><li><strong>Public Funding for Donation
    Storage, Capacity, and Education - </strong>The expansion of grant and loan
    programs by federal agencies, such as the US Department of Agriculture, can
    help businesses build processing capabilities, particularly on-farm where
    there are large opportunities for recovery. The federal and state
    governments could provide further grant programs to support infrastructure
    build out such as temperature-controlled food distribution infrastructure
    (e.g., refrigeration warehouses) and processing
    equipment.</li></ul><p>Funders can also help drive regional or coordinated
    efforts for asset sharing to improve overall logistics among various food
    recovery organizations.</p><ul><li><strong>Impact Investors Supplement
    Infrastructure for Food Rescue -</strong> Lack of infrastructure continues
    to be a roadblock for many food rescue organizations, whether it&rsquo;s the
    capacity to store or process food, a lack of local cold storage, or
    something as basic as not having a truck to deliver food. These gaps can be
    addressed by capital searching for impact. By and large, some of these
    issues are very local, which may not attract typical investors or even
    philanthropists that are looking for a scalable solution. Impact-First
    Investors should look locally to build infrastructure, as this type of
    investment can lead to significant long-term benefits for a
    community.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Expand Federal Food Donation Enhanced Tax Deduction or
    create State-Level Tax Incentive for Non-Profit Sales and Transportation
    Services</strong>- [Federal, State; Legislative] Under current law, in order
    for a donor to claim the federal enhanced deduction for food donation,
    donations must go to a non-profit organization that does not charge the end
    recipient for the food, thus excluding tax deductions for social
    supermarkets that sell donated food at an extremely discounted price, or
    food recovery organizations that charges $1 to recipients to help offset the
    costs of home delivery of donated foods. Expanding the federal enhanced tax
    deduction (or creating new state-level credits or deductions) to cover
    donations to the ultimate recipient at a deeply reduced price would help
    incentivize innovation in food recovery and donation. In addition, expanding
    the deduction (or creating new state-level credits or deductions) to cover
    transport services would help overcome one of the most expensive barriers to
    food recovery. These incentives could be provided at the federal or state
    level.</li><li><strong>Allow Application of Beginning Inventory Donations to
    Current Year Losses - </strong>[Federal; Regulatory] For those businesses
    that don&rsquo;t take the enhanced tax deduction, allowing them to count
    donations of prior year purchases (beginning inventory) to current year cost
    of goods losses would address a perverse incentive that currently
    discourages food donations. This change could be made by the IRS without
    Congressional action.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Clarify Guidance On Food Safety
    for Donations - </strong>[Federal, State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory]
    U.S. federal food safety legislation and regulations developed by FDA and
    USDA generally do not mention the food safety practices that should be
    followed for food donations, leading to confusion and a matrix of varying
    rules in different states and localities. These laws could be updated to
    feature donation-specific chapters, on topics such as temperature,
    transportation, and labeling of donated foods. Additionally, FDA and USDA
    could expand guidance to states and localities on food safety for donated
    food, including an update to the FDA Food Code to improve state restaurant
    and retail food safety and ease the process for state regulators to identify
    how the Food Code and other food safety laws apply to donations. In addition
    or in the alternative, state and local governments could also provide
    guidance or regulations to clarify relevant, donation-specific food safety
    requirements.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Strengthen Liability Protections for
    Food Donation - </strong>[Federal, State; Legislative] In order to encourage
    food donation, Congress or state legislatures could strengthen liability
    protections for food donation in a number of ways, including: 1) broadening
    protections to include food items sold at a low cost and donations
    transferred directly from donors to recipients; 2) granting administrative
    authority of Emerson Act regulations and guidance to USDA; and, 3)
    conducting an education campaign on donation liability protection for
    potential food donors and food recovery
    organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Require Government Agencies and
    Their Contractors to Report Food Donations - </strong>[Federal, State;
    Legislative] The existing Federal Food Donation Act requires federal
    agencies to encourage federal contractors to donate excess food, yet does
    not stipulate that agency food donation be tracked or monitored in any way.
    Congress could amend the Act to add a reporting requirement, in order to
    incentivize more food donation. Additionally, Congress could amend the Act
    to require covered contracts to include language mandating that agency
    contractors take steps to donate excess food by creating a written agreement
    with a food recovery organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Data-Sharing Technology - </strong>&nbsp;Real- or near-time
    data sharing technology could enable time-sensitive rescue opportunities by
    informing food type, quantity, condition, and location of product nearing
    expiration.</li><li><strong>Earned Revenue Models</strong> - Earned revenue
    business models for food recovery organizations can drive scalability and
    sustainability of recovery activities, especially when they include a strong
    return on investment for food donors.</li><li><strong>New Approaches to
    Labor</strong> - Increased automation and new business models can reduce
    food recovery organization reliance on volunteers and ensure a consistent
    labor force, a critical need that has been highlighted by the coronavirus
    pandemic.</li><li><strong>Sharing Platforms for Idle Assets</strong> - While
    transportation and cold storage are a limiting factor for food donations,
    many sit idle in businesses. Coordinating platforms and technologies are
    needed to fully leverage these idle cold storage and transportation assets
    and allow them to be used to expand food donation infrastructure at minimal
    cost.</li></ul>

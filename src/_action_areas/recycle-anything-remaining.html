    <ul><li><strong>Public Funding Expands Waste Disposal
    Infrastructure</strong> - Project finance from both government and
    commercial sources can unlock the building of food waste-related
    infrastructure with high upfront costs. Given the difference in required
    returns, commercial project finance seeks a profit motive and will finance
    solutions that lead to higher visible cash flows, such as anaerobic
    digesters (which have subsidies to make them economically viable) and
    composters. For the remaining solutions, which may provide a public good but
    are not as economically viable, government-sourced project finance will
    bridge the gap.</li><li><strong>Philanthropic Funding Bridges Financing Gap
    and Reduces Risk</strong> - Non-Government Grants and Impact First
    Investments can help bridge gaps in financing (particularly for more
    regional operations) and reduce real or perceived risks to business
    adoption. A case for this is urban-based restaurants needing to purchase
    storage units and grinders in order to enable
    composting.</li><li><strong>Corporate Finance Increases Long-Term
    Sustainability through Disposal Investments</strong> - Corporate Finance and
    Spending will provide a meaningful amount of the capital for these solutions
    through internally building capabilities or paying solution providers as
    they consider more sustainable methods of disposal.</li></ul>
  policy_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Disincentivize, Limit, or Ban Food from
    Landfills&ndash;</strong> [State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] Organic
    waste bans prohibit food waste from being sent to landfills, which in turn
    compels any business or other organization subject to the law (there are
    sometimes thresholds) to reduce their food waste. Organic waste bans are one
    of the most powerful ways to not only require recovery or recycling, but
    also incentivize preventative measures and food donations while also
    enabling measurement. Seven states currently have laws of this nature, as do
    several localities. Alternatively, while not as strong, increasing landfill
    tipping fees can achieve some of the same results by disincentivizing waste
    overall.</li><li><strong>Incentivize Implementation of State- and
    Local-Level Organic Waste Bans </strong>&ndash; [Federal; Legislative,
    Regulatory] For the first time, the Farm Bill of 2018 included a provision
    for the Federal government to incentivize local-level organic waste bans and
    food waste reduction programs by offering funding to build infrastructure or
    implement food waste reduction plans. Congress could expand and provide more
    funding for this existing program, which was initially only a pilot, and
    make similar funding available to state-level
    applicants.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Eliminate Restrictions and Barriers to
    Feeding of Food Scraps to Animals - </strong>[Federal, State; Legislative,
    Regulatory] Many restaurants, grocery stores, food manufacturers, and small
    and large farms have food scraps that are no longer edible for humans but
    are still safe and wholesome for animals. States could review and eliminate
    any overly stringent restrictions or bans on feeding food scraps to animals.
    In addition, USDA or state agencies could issue guidance on feeding food
    scraps to animals.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increase Landfill Tipping Fees -
    </strong>[State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] Landfills, both public and
    private, generally charge tipping fees to commercial waste producers who
    dispose of trash there. Factors that influence tipping fee rates include
    whether the landfill is public or private, availability of other revenue
    streams, location, disposal tonnage, and proximity to other landfills.
    Although tipping fees at individual landfills vary, a region&rsquo;s mean
    tipping fee is highly correlated with the percentage of waste disposed of in
    the region&rsquo;s landfills. By increasing landfill fees, state and local
    governments can incentivize businesses to donate surplus food rather than
    send it to the landfill.</li><li><strong>Provide Financial Support and
    Reduce Permitting Barriers for Food Waste Reduction Infrastructure</strong>
    - [Federal, State, Local; Legislative, Regulatory] State and local
    governments can break down barriers to food waste reduction by funding food
    recycling infrastructure, such as composting and anaerobic digestion.
    Funding can take the form of competitive grants, direct spending, or low
    interest financing. Furthermore, required permits from several disparate
    agencies can often present challenges for this infrastructure. States could
    take a dedicated look at streamlining this process.</li></ul>
  comms_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Employee Training and Incentives -</strong>&nbsp;Expanding
    employee training and waste reduction incentive programs within operations
    can increase adherence to proper food safety, handling, and preparation
    protocols.</li><li><strong>Cross-System Information Sharing
    -&nbsp;</strong>Encouraging data-enabled coordination and transparency
    across multiple stakeholders can address the current gaps in information and
    communication.</li><li><strong>Pre-Competitive Collaboration
    -&nbsp;</strong>Sharing pre-competitive industry knowledge can leverage
    expertise, encourage technology adoption and infrastructure build-out, and
    streamline standardization,</li><li><strong>Cultural and Behavior Change
    -</strong>&nbsp;Contributing to collective efforts in culture and behavior
    change can emphasize improved food utilization, waste reduction, and food
    management skills through education.</li><li><strong>Engaging More Players
    -&nbsp;</strong>Conducting outreach and education can engage new businesses,
    policymakers, capital providers, researchers, and community organizations in
    adopting food waste reduction measures.</li></ul>
  innovation_recommendations_html: >-
    <ul><li><strong>Smart Scales on Waste Trucks</strong> - &ldquo;Smart
    meter&rdquo; technologies in waste hauling need to be improved to give
    customers real-time measurement of waste quantities and enable new payment
    structures.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consolidated Organic Waste Feedstock
    -</strong> Technological, logistics, and contracting solutions are needed to
    address unpredictability and inconsistency of feedstock for composting and
    anaerobic digestion. Innovative contracts that de-risk investments and
    business-to-business platforms, such as shared waste transportation models,
    can create greater confidence in sourcing feedstock from food waste,
    generating demand for outputs and offering new revenue
    opportunities.</li><li><strong>Higher Energy Yields</strong> - Optimized
    anaerobic digestion and other bio-energy waste elimination solutions are
    needed to yield higher energy conversions and create greater profit
    potential.</li><li><strong>Distributed Models</strong> - Distributed models
    for composting and anaerobic digestion, such as digester units behind
    grocery stores, would minimize transportation and reliance on other players
    and waste sources.</li></ul>

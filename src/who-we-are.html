        <p class="lead editable">ReFED takes a data-driven approach to move the food system from acting on instinct to insights to solve our national food waste problem. Solutions already exist to cut food waste by 20% nationwide. ReFED has identified 27 of the best opportunities through the Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste, a first-of-its-kind economic analysis, making it easier for stakeholders across the food supply chain to meet the national 50% reduction goal by 2030.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5 editable">ReFED was launched in 2015 as a collaboration between more than 30 business, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing food waste in the United States. We created solutions for which were projected to catalyze tens of thousands of new jobs, recover billions of meals annually for the hungry, and reduce national water use and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
        
        <div class="editable">
          <p>ReFED was formed to create a Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste, the first ever national economic study and action plan driven by a multistakeholder group committed to tackling food waste at scale. The Roadmap was designed to fill the gap between awareness and action by creating transparency in the waste flows, costs, and opportunities of a more efficient food system achieved by preventing, recovering, and recycling food waste.</p>
          <p>In 2018, we launched our signature annual event, the Food Waste Summit (originally held in partnership with the Harvard Food Law and Policy Center), providing an opportunity for leaders from across the food system to share insights, ideas, and inspiration.</p>
          <p>In 2019, ReFED became a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. With more than a dozen employees located across the US and Canada, we are proud to play a central role in facilitating a reduction in food waste.</p>

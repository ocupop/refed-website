              <h4><strong>A Message from the Board of Directors</strong></h4>
              <p><strong></strong>On behalf of the Board of Directors and staff, it is with great admiration and gratitude that I announce that Chris Cochran has shared his plans to resign as the inaugural Executive Director of ReFED. Please join me in celebrating his tenure. Through Chris&rsquo; thought leadership and expertise, ReFED has evolved from a project and a desire to lead the nation in reducing food waste into a strong influential organization that has shifted the national conversation from awareness to action. We wish Chris great success in his future endeavors.While this marks the end of an important chapter in ReFED's growth, the Board is thrilled to announce that Dana Gunders will become our Interim Executive Director. As one of the nation&rsquo;s leading experts on the topic, we are confident in Dana&rsquo;s leadership and the team's ability to move ReFED forward into 2020 and beyond to build a more efficient and equitable food system with our stakeholders.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Jesse Fink,Chair,</p>
              <p>ReFED Board of Directors.&nbsp;</p>
              <h4><strong>A Letter from our Inaugural Executive Director, Chris Cochran</strong></h4>
              <p>Dear ReFED Community,After two and a half years as the inaugural Executive Director of ReFED, with pride in what we have accomplished and hope for the future, I have decided to resign from my role and pursue new professional opportunities. Two and a half years ago, ReFED was the<a target="_blank" href="https://www.refed.com/downloads/ReFED_Report_2016.pdf">&nbsp;2016 Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste by 20 Percent</a>&nbsp;and an idea that something more must be done. Since then, we have established ReFED as an independent nonprofit organization and a leading think-and-do tank to accelerate solutions to food waste. ReFED has developed distinctive roles as thought leader, convener and advisor. As thought leader, ReFED cemented our strength and reputation as the most trusted source of data, insights and guidance on food waste. We built on our foundation of the Roadmap and advanced knowledge across the food system through numerous reports and tools, culminating in the creation of the ReFED Insights Engine. As convener, we have gathered a multistakeholder network of thought leaders and decision-makers to enable collective action, including as host of the 2019 Food Waste Summit. We have also formed unique partnerships with nonprofits, government agencies and industry associations to coordinate our efforts and maximize our impact. As advisor, we have catalyzed action through capital and innovation. We have advised leading foundations, investors and businesses and created a first-of-its-kind nonprofit Food Recovery Accelerator.It has been a privilege and a joy to work with all of you, the hundreds of thought leaders and decision-makers from across the public, private and nonprofit sectors, to create a more efficient and equitable food system. We come from a wide variety of stakeholder groups: food and technology companies, startups, investors, foundations, nonprofits and policymakers. We have a wide spectrum of motivations ranging from hunger relief to job creation, environmental impact to financial returns. However, we hold this in common: we see food waste as a solvable problem and a tremendous opportunity to create value.I am incredibly proud of what we have accomplished together as we have pivoted the food waste reduction movement from building awareness to scaling action to achieve our common goal to cut food waste in half by 2030. Food waste is a burgeoning sector of technology and business model innovation with hundreds of millions of dollars being invested in cost-effective solutions. In addition, enabling policies are being deployed at the federal, state and local level. Our work is not done. Achieving our common goal to cut food waste in half will require our sustained collective action. As I depart, I am confident that ReFED will continue to play a critical role in the food waste reduction movement, addressing the pressing issues of our time, including climate change, food insecurity, chronic disease and economic disparity. ReFED is equipped with a clear strategy and distinctive strengths to enable its next chapter of scaled impact. I have confidence in the Board, team and Dana Gunders&rsquo; leadership as interim Executive Director. I wish ReFED great success in the future and look forward to supporting the organization in new ways in my next chapter.It has been a privilege to work with each of you. I look forward to continuing our relationship in new capacities as we pursue our shared mission to create an efficient and equitable food system.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Chris Cochran.</p>

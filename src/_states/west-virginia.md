        enforcement: >-
          The commissioner enforces the garbage-feeding rule. § 19-9A-7 (2015).

          individual or facility that has violated the garbage-feeding rule.
          § 19-9A-4 (2015).



          Any authorized representative of the commissioner has the power to
          investigate private or public property on which garbage is being
          heat-treated to be fed to swine. The commissioner also may require
          garbage heat-treating facilities to maintain records, to allow the
          commissioner to inspect such records, and to submit copies of such
          records to the commissioner upon request. § 19-9A-6 (2015).



          Any individual or facility that violates the garbage-feeding rule is

        animals_covered: Swine
        definition_of_garbage: 'Putrescible animal and vegetable wastes resulting from the handling, preparation, cooking, and consumption of foods including animal carcasses or parts thereof. § 19-9A-1 (2015).'

        treatment_requirements: All garbage fed to swine must be thoroughly heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 30 minutes or else treated in some other manner approved by the commissioner. § 19-9A-5 (2015).
        enforcement: >-
          The commissioner enforces the garbage-feeding rule. § 19-9A-7 (2015).

          individual or facility that has violated the garbage-feeding rule.
          § 19-9A-4 (2015).









          Any authorized representative of the commissioner has the power to
          investigate private or public property on which garbage is being
          heat-treated to be fed to swine. The commissioner also may require
          garbage heat-treating facilities to maintain records, to allow the
          commissioner to inspect such records, and to submit copies of such
          records to the commissioner upon request. § 19-9A-6 (2015).









          Any individual or facility that violates the garbage-feeding rule is

          individual or facility also may be enjoined from continuing the

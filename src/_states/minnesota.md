          Subp. 7. Open date. “Open date” means a date consisting of the name or
          abbreviation ornumerical designation for the month, the numerical
          designation for the day of the month, and the name or abbreviation for
          the day of the week as provided herein, and if appropriate, the year.
          An open date may be one of the following:A. Date of manufacture: the
          date the product was manufactured or processed. This datewould be used
          with a statement such as “Use within 40 days of date shown” or other
          similar phrasing.B. Date of packaging: the date the product was placed
          in the retail package in advance ofsale. This date would be used with
          a statement such as “Use within 30 days of date shown”or other similar
          phrasing.C. Pull date: the recommended last date for retail sale. With
          this date use a statement suchas “Not to be sold after date shown” or
          “Do not sell after date shown” or “Last day of sale”or some equivalent
          phrasing.D. Freshness date (quality assurance date): of the last date
          which the manufacturer orprocessor estimates the product will retain
          its original freshness or peak quality. With thisdate use a statement
          such as “For maximum freshness use before date shown” or
          otherequivalent phrasing.E. Expiration date: the last date the product
          can be expected to perform in a manner equal to consumer expectations.
          With this date use a statement such as “For best results use before
          the date shown” or other equivalent phrasing.F. Shelf display date:
          the date used by a retailer to indicate when an item was put on
          display.The purpose of this date, if used, is to aid in the proper
          rotation of stock and it would be used by the retailer on those
          perishable foods which have short shelf life and which are
          exemptherein from open dating.Subp. 8. Quality assurance date.
          “Quality assurance date” means any date after which themanufacturer or
          processor reasonably determines that the product may, by spoilage,
          wilt age, drying, or any other foreseeable and natural phenomenon,
          lose its palatability or its desired or nutritive properties. As used
          in these parts, “quality assurance date” signifies a period of time
          beginning with the date of manufacture or the date when the food is
          packed for retail sale and ending with an open date as defined and
          explained in subpart 7.

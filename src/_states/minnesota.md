          Subp. 7. Open date. “Open date” means a date consisting of the name or
          abbreviation or

          numerical designation for the month, the numerical designation for the
          day of the month, and the name or abbreviation for the day of the week
          as provided herein, and if appropriate, the year. An open date may be
          one of the following:

          A. Date of manufacture: the date the product was manufactured or
          processed. This date

          would be used with a statement such as “Use within 40 days of date
          shown” or other similar phrasing.

          B. Date of packaging: the date the product was placed in the retail
          package in advance of

          sale. This date would be used with a statement such as “Use within 30
          days of date shown”

          or other similar phrasing.

          C. Pull date: the recommended last date for retail sale. With this date
          use a statement such

          as “Not to be sold after date shown” or “Do not sell after date shown”
          or “Last day of sale”

          or some equivalent phrasing.

          D. Freshness date (quality assurance date): of the last date which the
          manufacturer or

          processor estimates the product will retain its original freshness or
          peak quality. With this

          date use a statement such as “For maximum freshness use before date
          shown” or other

          equivalent phrasing.

          E. Expiration date: the last date the product can be expected to
          perform in a manner equal to consumer expectations. With this date use
          a statement such as “For best results use before the date shown” or
          other equivalent phrasing.

          F. Shelf display date: the date used by a retailer to indicate when an
          item was put on display.

          The purpose of this date, if used, is to aid in the proper rotation of
          stock and it would be used by the retailer on those perishable foods
          which have short shelf life and which are exempt

          herein from open dating.

          Subp. 8. Quality assurance date. “Quality assurance date” means any
          date after which the

          manufacturer or processor reasonably determines that the product may,
          by spoilage, wilt age, drying, or any other foreseeable and natural
          phenomenon, lose its palatability or its desired or nutritive
          properties. As used in these parts, “quality assurance date” signifies
          a period of time beginning with the date of manufacture or the date
          when the food is packed for retail sale and ending with an open date as
          defined and explained in subpart 7.

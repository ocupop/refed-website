          “sell by” or “best if used by” in reasonable proximity to the
          designated date. (2) Such a date shall consist of the common
          abbreviation for the calendar month and numerals for the day and year,
          e.g., Feb. 10, 1980; or numerals for the month, day and year, e.g.,

          (b) Fresh bakery products may be dated with only the day designation,
          e.g., Monday, or an abbreviation thereof, e.g., Mon. (3) A date shall
          be accompanied by disclosure of recommended product storage
          conditions, if such conditions significantly affect the validity of

          be printed, stamped, embossed, perforated, or otherwise shown on the
          retail package, a label on such package, or a tag attached to such
          package in a manner that is easily readable and separate from other
          information, graphics, or lettering so as to be clearly visible to a
          prospective purchaser. (5) If a date and recommended storage
          conditions do not appear on the principal display panel, the
          information panel, or on another conspicuous portion of the individual
          retail package, a statement must appear on the principal display or
          information panel indicating where such information can be found
          elsewhere on the package. (6) An individual prepackaged food product
          which is not labeled in accordance with the provisions of 105 CMR
          520.119 shall be deemed “mis-branded” pursuant to M.G.L. c. 94, § 187.

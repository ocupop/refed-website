    overview: 'Tennessee does not recommend feeding animal-derived waste to swine.97 But Tennessee allows the feeding of animal-derived and vegetable waste to swine provided that it has been processed in accordance with federal law (that is, heat-treated and fed by a licensed facility). Feeders must submit a plan to the commissioner detailing how garbage will be processed. Food waste that consists of only bakery waste, whey, and dairy waste from milk processing plants may be fed to swine without being further processed. Individuals may feed household garbage to their own swine without processing it.'

          Garbage must be processed in a manner prescribed and approved by the
          commissioner, meaning that feeders must submit a written plan to the

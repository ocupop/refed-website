          property at reasonable times to inspect and investigate
          garbage-treating and garbage-feeding operations. An authorized
          representative also may examine records pertaining to those operations,
          may require maintenance of those records, and may require copies of
          those records to be submitted to the department periodically.
          § 81-2-505 (2015).

















          The department of agriculture has the authority to restrain
          garbage-feeding operations in violation of the garbage-feeding rule.

          garbage-feeding rule and other state laws. § 81-2-508 (2015).

          six months or less. Violators may also be enjoined from continuing such
          violation. Each day of the violation counts as a separate offense.

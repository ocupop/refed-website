      summary: 'Montana bans the sale or donation of milk 12 or more days after pasteurization. The industry standard is to date milk 21 days past pasteurization, nearly twice as long as the time allowed in Montana. As a result, thousands of gallons of safe-to-drink milk get thrown away each week. By eliminating its ban on the sale of past-date milk, a ban that is not supported by science, Montana could help reduce milk waste while allowing wholesome products to end up in the hands of those who want them.'

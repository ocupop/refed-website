    - title: Arbitrary bans on donating or selling past date foods
      summary: 'Montana bans the sale or donation of milk 12 or more days after pasteurization. The industry standard is to date milk 21 days past pasteurization, nearly twice as long as the time allowed in Montana. As a result, thousands of gallons of safe-to-drink milk get thrown away weekly. By eliminating its ban on the sale of past-date milk, a ban that is not supported by science, Montana could help reduce milk waste and allow wholesome products to get to those who want them.'

    - title: Does Not Require or Regulate Date Labels
      summary: 'New York City is an example of a government choosing to eliminate unnecessary date labels. New York City used to require dates on milk, even though the state of New York imposes no date labeling requirements on any foods. The city repealed its date labeling requirement for milk in 2010 to harmonize with state regulations. The city recognized that its date label requirement was not necessary to protect public health because milk, if handled properly, is still safe to consume even after the date passes (and if handled improperly, the date is irrelevant in any case).'

      summary: "Wisconsin protects nonprofits that charge end recipients for food at low cost. A handful of states, including Wisconsin, provide liability protection even when the food is sold at a reduced rate to the end recipient. Wisconsin's law allows nonprofit food recovery organizations to charge recipients for food \"at a price not to exceed overhead and transportation costs\" without sacrificing liability protection. States that provide this protection offer the potential for an economically sustainable solution to food recovery because they allow the labor, storage and transportation costs of recovering food to be offset by end-user purchases."

      summary: "Currently, most states follow the Emerson Act’s model of providing liability protection only when the donated food fully complies with all federal, state and local quality and labeling requirements. These requirements impose extraneous burdens on donors and food recovery organizations by forcing them to meet all labeling standards. However, some states, like Oregon, eliminate compliance with packaging or labeling laws as a condition for liability protection. Oregon's statute states that liability protection applies \"regardless of compliance with any laws, rules or ordinances regulating the packaging or labeling of food.\" This allows donation of partially compliant food and absolves donors of any duty placed on the food recovery organization to recondition the food as compliant."

      summary: 'The majority of state liability protection statutes provide liability protection only for food donated to a nonprofit food recovery organization, which then distributes the food to end users. However, some states, like New Hampshire, provide liability protection to donors donating to a "needy individual or individuals or to a bona fide charitable or nonprofit organization." Extending protections to direct donations could help increase efficiency and enable timely use of perishable food.'

    - title: California Tax Incentives
      summary: "California helps alleviate the costs associated with food donation by offering a tax credit that explicitly covers the costs associated with the transportation of any agricultural product donated to a nonprofit. The tax credit is allowed as a credit against the “net tax” in an amount equal to 50% of the transportation costs paid or incurred. Because many businesses cite the costs of transporting food items as a key barrier to donation, California’s model is worth analyzing for potential applicability."

For example, Virginia's Food Crop Donation Tax Credit is available to individuals and corporate entities engaged in the business of farming food crops and donating such crops to nonprofit food banks. The amount of the credit is equal to 30% of the fair market value of the crops; claims are capped at $5,000 per year."

      summary: 'South Carolina provides a tax credit for licensed meat packers, butchers or processing plants that contract with charitable organizations to process deer for donation to those in need. The deer in question are typically hunted for sport and would not be eaten, meaning that it does not make sense to compensate the “producers”—in this case, hunters—for donating their surplus animals. Instead, South Carolina’s scheme recognizes that processing costs represent the most significant cost barrier for recovering this particular food source. The tax credit offers licensed meat packers, butchers and processing plants $50 per carcass donated in order to recover a large amount of high-value meat for low-income households.'

      summary: 'Even though the practice of feeding food scraps to animals is safe for human and animal health, several states either ban the feeding of all food scraps, animal-derived food scraps, and/or vegetable-derived food scraps to animals, specifically swine. Connecticut is one of many states that provide a good model for regulating feeding food scraps to animals. Connecticut allows the feeding of animal-derived waste to swine provided that it has been properly heat-treated and is fed by a licensed facility. All other waste, including vegetable waste, may be fed to swine without heat treatment. Individuals may feed household garbage to their own swine without heat-treating it and without obtaining a permit. As long as food scraps are properly handled according to applicable federal food safety laws and regulations, feeding food scraps to animals can be a safe and beneficial practice.'

North Carolina, the second-largest producer of swine, is one of many states that provide a good model for regulating feeding food scraps to animals. It allows the feeding of animal-derived waste to swine provided that it has been properly heat-treated and fed by a licensed facility. All other waste, such as vegetable-derived waste, may be fed to swine without heat-treatment. This is the rule in the majority of states that allow food scraps to be fed to animals."

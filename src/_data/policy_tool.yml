    - title: Arbitrary bans on donating or selling past date foods
      summary: 'Montana bans the sale or donation of milk 12 or more days after pasteurization. The industry standard is to date milk 21 days past pasteurization, nearly twice as long as the time allowed in Montana. As a result, thousands of gallons of safe-to-drink milk get thrown away each week. By eliminating its ban on the sale of past-date milk, a ban that is not supported by science, Montana could help reduce milk waste while allowing wholesome products to end up in the hands of those who want them.'

      summary: 'New York City is an example of a government choosing to eliminate unnecessary date labels. New York City used to require dates on milk, even though the state of New York imposes no date labeling requirements on any foods. The city repealed its date labeling requirement for milk in 2010 to harmonize with state regulations. The city recognized that its date label requirement was not necessary to protect public health because milk, if handled properly, is still safe to consume even after the date passes (and if handled improperly, the date is irrelevant in any case).'

So long as the food recovery organization does not make a profit off the distribution, it will be shielded from liability.

    - title: California tax incentives
      summary: 'California helps alleviate the costs associated with food donation by offering a tax credit that explicitly covers the costs associated with the transportation of any agricultural product donated to a nonprofit charitable organization. The tax credit is allowed as a credit against the “net tax” in an amount equal to 50% of the transportation costs paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the transportation of that donated agricultural product. Because many businesses cite the costs of transporting food items as a key barrier to donation, California’s model is worth analyzing for potential applicability.'

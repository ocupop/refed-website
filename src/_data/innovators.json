The surrounding fruit is discarded, often dumped into rivers or left to rot in heaps. So we invented something better to do with it. Something that’s better for everyone. For food & beverage companies, it is an all-natural, clean-label, nutrient-dense and distinctly flavorful ingredient as a sustainable found food.  ",

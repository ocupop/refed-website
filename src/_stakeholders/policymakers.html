  <p>Policymakers are not waste generators, but they still play an important
  role in food waste reduction by enacting policies that can accelerate the
  adoption of solutions at a large scale. In the U.S., policy related to food
  waste can exist at the federal, state, and local levels and is inclusive of
  legislative and regulatory requirements.</p><p>In recent years, Policymakers
  have established pre-competitive business standards; driven sector-wide
  action; removed barriers to solutions implementation; provided financing to
  help overcome the stumbling block of misaligned incentives; and
  more.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the characteristics of each policy and the extent to
  which they promote or impede food waste reduction efforts vary significantly
  &mdash; by incentivizing good practices, penalizing bad behavior, or
  clarifying what activities are allowed &ndash; each has the power to provide a
  spark that can move the food system to action.</p>

        Disincentivize, Limit, or Ban Food from Landfills– [State, Local;
        Legislative, Regulatory]

      description_html: >-
        <p>Organic waste bans prohibit food waste from being sent to landfills,
        which in turn compels any business or other organization subject to the
        law (there are sometimes thresholds) to reduce their food waste. Organic
        waste bans are one of the most powerful ways to not only require
        recovery or recycling, but also incentivize preventative measures and
        food donations while also enabling measurement. Seven states currently
        have laws of this nature, as do several localities. Alternatively, while
        not as strong, increasing landfill tipping fees can achieve some of the
        same results by disincentivizing waste overall.</p>

        Incentivize Implementation of State- and Local-Level Organic Waste Bans
        – [Federal; Legislative, Regulatory]
      action_areas:
        - recycle-anything-remaining
      description_html: >-
        <p>For the first time, the Farm Bill of 2018 included a provision for
        the Federal government to incentivize local-level organic waste bans and
        food waste reduction programs by offering funding to build
        infrastructure or implement food waste reduction plans. Congress could
        expand and provide more funding for this existing program, which was
        initially only a pilot, and make similar funding available to
        state-level applicants.&nbsp;</p>

        Eliminate Restrictions and Barriers to Feeding of Food Scraps to
        Animals, - [Federal, State; Legislative, Regulatory]
      action_areas:
        - maximize-product-utilization
        - recycle-anything-remaining
      description_html: >-
        <p>Many restaurants, grocery stores, food manufacturers, and small and
        large farms have food scraps that are no longer edible for humans but
        are still safe and wholesome for animals. States could review and
        eliminate any overly stringent restrictions or bans on feeding food
        scraps to animals. In addition, USDA or state agencies could issue
        guidance on feeding food scraps to animals.&nbsp;</p>

      action_areas:

        - recycle-anything-remaining
      description_html: >-
        <p>Landfills, both public and private, generally charge tipping fees to
        commercial waste producers who dispose of trash there. Factors that
        influence tipping fee rates include whether the landfill is public or
        private, availability of other revenue streams, location, disposal
        tonnage, and proximity to other landfills. Although tipping fees at
        individual landfills vary, a region&rsquo;s mean tipping fee is highly
        correlated with the percentage of waste disposed of in the
        region&rsquo;s landfills. By increasing landfill fees, state and local
        governments can incentivize businesses to donate surplus food rather
        than send it to the landfill.</p>

      description_html: >-
        <p>The federal government or state governments could provide grant
        programs to support the costs of temperature-controlled food
        distribution infrastructure (e.g. refrigeration warehouses), as well as
        processing infrastructure equipment and facilities to freeze or convert
        donated or excess food in products such as soups, sauces, and
        jams.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        - refine-product-management
        - strengthen-food-rescue
      description_html: >-
        <p>Lack of cold storage and transportation is a limiting factor for
        donation of perishables. Congress or state legislatures could provide
        funding for temperature-controlled food distribution infrastructure
        (e.g. refrigeration warehouses, temperature-controlled packaging and
        transportation) to handle additional food donation
        volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

        Provide Financial Support and Reduce Permitting Barriers for Food Waste
        Reduction Infrastructure - [Federal, State, Local; Legislative,
        Regulatory]
      action_areas:
        - recycle-anything-remaining
      description_html: >-
        <p>State and local governments can break down barriers to food waste
        reduction by funding food recycling infrastructure, such as composting
        and anaerobic digestion. Funding can take the form of competitive
        grants, direct spending, or low interest financing. Furthermore,
        required permits from several disparate agencies can often present
        challenges for this infrastructure. States could take a dedicated look
        at streamlining this process.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Public policy at the federal, state, and municipal levels can offer
    opportunities to accelerate large-scale food waste reduction. The Food Waste
    Policy Finder – developed by ReFED and the Harvard Law School Food Law and
    Policy Clinic to provide an overview of current federal and state policies
    related to food waste – depicts the existing policy landscape, while
    highlighting best-practice legislation in order to inform the continued
    development and implementation of sound food waste policy.</p>

Each policy is tagged to highlight which of the seven key action areas from our <em>Roadmap to 2030</em> &ndash; <em>Optimize the Harvest</em>, <em>Enhance Supply Chains</em>, <em>Refine Production Management</em>, <em>Maximize Product Utilization</em>, <em>Reshape Consumer Environments</em>, <em>Strengthen Food Rescue</em>, and <em>Recycle Anything Remaining</em> &ndash; they would influence. The enactment of these and other related policies can be the critical linchpin in achieving the nation&rsquo;s 2030 food waste reduction goal.</p>

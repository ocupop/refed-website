  <p>In the fight against food waste, <em>Capital Providers</em> play an
  integral role in paying for the development and adoption of food waste
  solutions &ndash; many of which have a strong potential for investment
  returns. Capital aids the food waste system by funding innovation and R&amp;D;
  offsetting the costs of donating food; purchasing equipment for waste
  reduction operations; and more. In many cases, certain initiatives are not
  adopted solely because of a lack of resources &ndash; which is why it&rsquo;s
  critically important for <em>Capital Providers</em> to understand the
  opportunities associated with funding food waste reduction solutions.</p>

    <h2>An Investment of $18B Per Year Can Deliver $109B in Annual Net Economic
    Benefit</h2><p>Based on an extensive analysis of public and proprietary data
    from across the entire food system, ReFED estimates that the U.S. can
    achieve a reduction in food waste of 43 million tons, deliver $109 billion
    in annual net economic benefit for the country, avoid 70 million tons of
    GHGs, rescue&nbsp;<strong>AA</strong>&nbsp;meals, create 64,000 jobs
    &ndash;&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;achieve the nation's 2030 goal of a 50%
    reduction in food waste &ndash; by investing $18 billion per year over the
    next ten years to implement food waste prevention, rescue, and recycling
    solutions.</p>

      <p>Government grants are considered to be concessionary, philanthropic
      capital at the federal, state, and/or local level that can support
      initiatives often lacking a market-based application (i.e., that lack a
      profit motive) or do not yield direct, monetizable benefits (i.e.,
      longer-term projects with higher positive externalities, such as consumer
      education<em> </em>programs). This funding may play the role of
      &ldquo;first capital in&rdquo; for solutions that are perceived to be high
      risk. Government grant programs can be highly impactful when funding
      nonprofit and for-profit solutions that support the public good.</p>

          This capital type can be beneficial in kick-starting the startup costs
          of organizations working to ensure that what is grown is utilized to
          its highest and best purpose. Government grants have previously
          assisted initiatives focused on creating markets for imperfect
          produce; this will likely continue, as others form and incentives need
          to be provided to encourage producers to harvest produce that would
          otherwise be left behind, which often requires additional picking and
          packing costs. Additionally, program-specific government grant funding
          can aid in the ongoing costs associated with on-farm gleaning and

          Despite this being one of the most impactful action areas to fight
          food waste, the associated solutions (e.g., Consumer Education
          Campaigns, K-12 Lunch Improvements) can be harder to fund by more
          traditional sources of capital, since the return on investment is
          mostly derived from societal good and lacks a direct financial return.
          Especially for those solutions that drive the most impact but require
          a significant investment to work effectively at changing behaviors,
          government sources may be the most appropriate capital provider. That
          said, governments could invest in partnership with private
          stakeholders, including philanthropic funders, in consumer education
          efforts that increase awareness, offer food waste reduction
          strategies, and promote a culture of active waste avoidance.
          Additionally, government grants may be necessary to incentivize
          changes, particularly from a health and nutrition perspective. Grants
          covering the upfront costs of Trayless Dining systems and training can
          incentivize changes in smaller restaurants and medium-sized chains.
          Different levels of government can also provide grants to trade
          associations, academia, or nonprofits for areas requiring further
          research, such as Package Design and their impact on waste levels.

          Government grants have a role to play in the intersection of food
          waste, hunger relief, and food donation – particularly in supporting
          donation education through grants to organizations focused on
          corporate and nonprofit education on policy, legislation, food safety,
          and liability.  Additionally, government grants have a role in the
          early stages of food rescue initiatives by funding upfront costs. The
          expansion of grant and loan programs by federal agencies, such as the
          US Department of Agriculture, can help businesses expand processing
          capabilities, particularly on-farm where there are large opportunities
          for recovery. Funders can also help drive regional or coordinated
          efforts for asset sharing to improve overall logistics among various
          food recovery organizations. Funding sources from government
          agriculture programs may also contribute through the sourcing of
          healthy, fresh, and culturally appropriate foods for donation.

          with other community assets to increase non-financial benefits, such
          as job creation and educational opportunities. Local government grant
          programs can help fund enabling technologies for recycling, such as
          waste hauling, dehydration, and depackaging. For smaller at-home
          solutions such as composting, local governments can also support the

          This is one of the most impactful action areas to fight food waste,
          but the associated solutions (e.g., Consumer Education Campaigns, K-12
          Lunch Improvements, etc.) can be harder to fund from more traditional
          sources of capital, since the return on investment is mostly derived
          from societal good and lacks direct financial return. Especially for
          those solutions that drive the most impact, but require a significant
          investment to work effectively at changing behaviors, non-government
          sources of capital may be the most appropriate capital provider.
          Philanthropic funders with local or regional ties can extend and
          supplement the reach of national campaigns to address additional
          customer segments. Grants covering the upfront costs of Trayless
          Dining systems and training can incentivize changes in smaller
          restaurants and medium-sized chains. Philanthropic funders can fund
          consumer education on new date labeling practices in partnership with
          manufacturers or retailers.

      <p>Tax incentives &ndash; whether in the form of credits or deductions
      &ndash; induce farms, retailers, restaurants, and foodservice providers to
      undertake the behavioral and operational changes needed to donate surplus
      food, instead of sending it to lower destinations on the food recovery
      hierarchy, especially landfill. Tax incentives are a powerful tool that
      can be used by government and legislative stakeholders. Historically, a
      portion of businesses that qualify for tax incentives do not file for
      them, which likely reduces the actual tax burden by a significant amount.
      Expanded tax incentives for the transportation of rescue/donated food
      would unlock food that was deemed not economical by our current system.
      Additionally, targeted tax incentives can be impactful to support
      recycling projects (on a state or local level) or general corporate
      R&amp;D.</p>

      <p>Venture Capital can play a meaningful role in food waste solutions that
      are in the earlier stages of development. This funding type is uniquely
      capable of investing in cutting-edge innovation (including hardware- and
      software-driven solutions) and disruptive business models with a large
      potential total addressable market and those that have the potential for
      significant financial return given the level of risk assumed per
      investment. As a result, Venture Capital will be valuable in focusing its
      financing to for-profit organizations fighting food waste that have
      well-defined products and services, solid sales visibility and traction,
      and the ability to scale quickly.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer: The below

      solutions can positively impact corporate operations, thereby requiring
      the use of Corporate Finance and Spending.&nbsp;</p>

          Corporate Finance and Spending-type funding is often most appropriate
          for solutions in this action area, as these can be implemented
          internally by food organizations. Solutions such as Buyer Spec
          Expansion and Imperfect Produce Lines will create additional revenue
          opportunities. Food retailers have a significant amount of influence
          upstream in the supply chain and can implement these solutions
          alongside appropriate operational changes. Their internally generated
          capital will be directed towards researching customer preferences of
          specific types of food, sourcing off-spec food, transportation, and
          the implementation of new processes. Alternatively, direct-to-consumer
          business can enable these solutions as well.

          Corporate Finance and Spending is expected to be the largest bucket of
          financing required for solutions in this action area, since
          corporations can bear the implementation costs for these solutions
          while also receiving a great portion of the financial benefits. While
          some of these solutions increase costs (e.g., transport), this may be
          offset by increased revenue opportunities (e.g., more options for
          customers) and reduced costs of food waste disposal. Additionally,
          food businesses are likely to assess whether it is best to internally
          develop these capabilities or partner with outside developers of
          solutions such as Markdown Alert Applications and Enhanced Demand
          Planning. These types of technology-enabled solutions may attract the
          attention of organizations who service food businesses – such as other

          scale.

          A number of solutions in this action area are expected to be mostly
          financed through Corporate Finance and Spending, given that they are
          often a corporate decision with potential financial benefits.
          Corporate Finance and Spending has a role to play in funding Consumer
          Education Campaigns, because retail organizations are important
          distribution points for food-related information (e.g., at the point
          of sale). Even a national, government-funded consumer education
          program can benefit from support from private stakeholders such as
          food businesses to help increase awareness, offer strategies for food
          waste reduction, and promote a culture of active waste avoidance.
          Corporations will not necessarily be viewing this type of spending
          from a return on investment perspective, but rather as a broad
          Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) or CSR strategy and/or
          brand/reputation building.

          solutions, in the most basic sense of connecting with food

          disposing of waste is already a cost of doing business that could be

          solutions, overall increased demand can make a stronger case for the
          further build out of projects on the government and investor side.

      <p>Government Project Finance (sourced from direct municipal, state, or

      powerful role in funding infrastructure projects that require a
      significant amount of capital and whose funding needs are not met from
      commercial sources, but which meet policy goals. Typical food waste
      solutions that benefit all of society rather than a specific stakeholder
      group are <em>Co-Digestion at Wastewater Plants</em> and various
      composting initiatives. Especially since these assets may not generate a
      market return and require a long-term view on societal benefits,
      government stakeholders are the most appropriate provider of capital.
      Government Project Finance is a lower cost alternative to commercial
      finance &ndash; which allows for it to be more flexible in stimulating a
      larger number of projects to be built.&nbsp;</p>

      solutions in this Recycle Anything Remaining, as they steadily generate
      cash flows and provide a return on investment that is indexed to
      inflation. Given the hard-asset nature of these projects, low-cost debt is
      able to be applied to this investment. Commercial Project Finance is
      expected to come from for-profit financiers such as financial
      institutions, pension funds, and specialty infrastructure investors.
      Additionally, for assets that generate a public good, Commercial Project
      Financiers benefit from various stakeholders, such as governments,
      backstopping the investment and providing first-in capital whereby the
      project is first de-risked by government funding, with Commercial Project
      Finance and other investors then providing the remainder of funds. This
      dynamic of public-private partnerships or private investment in
      infrastructure fuels the development, construction, and operation of
      multi-million-dollar infrastructure projects which will have long-term
      positive effects. Smaller projects can also use targeted Commercial

          Tax incentives by design are intended to offset the incremental costs
          of donating (e.g., labor, storage, and ideally transportation) and
          cover some of the losses incurred by the food business. There is the
          potential to unlock “trapped” food in our system with an ambitious
          approach to tax incentives – both broadly by encouraging donations and
          more targeted through building out infrastructure and overcoming
          roadblocks such as transportation and storage.

          Commercial Project Finance is needed to fund organics recycling
          infrastructure projects that have the potential to be profitable by
          generating compost, service fees, or energy. For these solutions,
          Project Finance can be used to cover the upfront initial investment of
          facilities and larger pieces of equipment. In some cases, these
          projects can also be funded via a joint effort from public and private
          sources.

          <h2>Types of Capital Providers</h2>
          <p>Multiple types of capital exist and can come from a variety of sources, each with unique underlying goals and investment theses. Effective action against food waste requires a smart matching of the correct type of capital with the appropriate opportunity, and in many cases, multiple types of capital are required to fund food waste reduction solutions from conception to adoption. Below, we&rsquo;ve reviewed the role of nine different capital types in supporting food waste reduction &ndash; within each capital type, we&rsquo;ve highlighted the financing opportunities associated with the seven key action areas from our <em>Roadmap to 2030</em>, as well as the specific investment needed to fund the associated solutions.</p>
          <p><em>Disclaimer: A particular financing need may be met from a variety of sources. As such, these estimates and funding mix recommendations are only approximations of the scale of resources needed to achieve our national goal to reduce food loss and waste by 50% by the year 2030</em></p>

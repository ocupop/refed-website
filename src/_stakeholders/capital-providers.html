      <p>Government grants are considered to be concessionary, philanthropic
      capital at the federal, state, and/or local level that can support
      initiatives often lacking a market-based application (i.e., that lack a
      profit motive) or do not yield direct, monetizable benefits (i.e.,
      longer-term projects with higher positive externalities, such as consumer
      education<em> </em>programs). This funding may play the role of
      &ldquo;first capital in&rdquo; for solutions that are perceived to be high
      risk. Government grant programs can be highly impactful when funding
      nonprofit and for-profit solutions that support the public good.</p>

          This capital type can be beneficial in kick-starting the startup costs
          of organizations working to ensure that what is grown is utilized to
          its highest and best purpose. Government grants have previously
          assisted initiatives focused on creating markets for imperfect
          produce; this will likely continue, as others form and incentives need
          to be provided to encourage producers to harvest produce that would
          otherwise be left behind, which often requires additional picking and
          packing costs. Additionally, program-specific government grant funding
          can aid in the ongoing costs associated with on-farm gleaning and
          donation efforts.

          <h2>Types of Capital Providers</h2>
          <p>Multiple types of capital exist and can come from a variety of sources, each with unique underlying goals and investment theses. Effective action against food waste requires a smart matching of the correct type of capital with the appropriate opportunity, and in many cases, multiple types of capital are required to fund food waste reduction solutions from conception to adoption. Below, we&rsquo;ve reviewed the role of nine different capital types in supporting food waste reduction &ndash; within each capital type, we&rsquo;ve highlighted the financing opportunities associated with the seven key action areas from our <em>Roadmap to 2030</em>, as well as the specific investment needed to fund the associated solutions.</p>
          <p><em>Disclaimer: A particular financing need may be met from a variety of sources. As such, these estimates and funding mix recommendations are only approximations of the scale of resources needed to achieve our national goal to reduce food loss and waste by 50% by the year 2030</em></p>

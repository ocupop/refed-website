  - title: Oxygen Masks On
    description_html: >-
      <p>Elizabeth has picked up on many organizations&rsquo; eagerness to seize
      opportunities to help and progress. However, just as airlines remind you
      to &ldquo;put your oxygen mask on before helping others,&rdquo; Elizabeth
      reminds us that &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re not on solid financial footing
      yourself, you won&rsquo;t be able to help the sector or the world for very
      long.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s therefore important to prioritize your own
      organization&rsquo;s financial health in the short- and long-term. By
      doing so, you&rsquo;re helping others, too.</p>
  - title: Take Your Time
    description_html: >-
      <p>Relatedly, in order to &ldquo;put your oxygen mask on first,&rdquo;
      Elizabeth recommends taking your time to weigh the major financial
      decisions you&rsquo;re making and to prepare accordingly. There&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;pressure to &lsquo;keep up with the Joneses&rsquo; by constantly
      communicating your COVID response externally,&rdquo; when what&rsquo;s
      really needed is diligent financial planning. &ldquo;Good work takes
      time,&rdquo; she reminds us.</p>

  <p>The 2021 Food Waste Summit will focus on the actions we need to take as we
  enter the final decade of our global goals to cut food waste in half. In
  addition to celebrating big collective wins and highlighting innovation and
  key initiatives in the sector, ReFED will release data, insights, and guidance
  from the brand new ReFED Insights Engine. Together we can build a more
  sustainable, resilient, inclusive food system. Seize the moment and join
  us!</p>

              <div class="card-text">Solutions that prevent food from being wasted in the first place, such as standardized date labeling, consumer education campaigns, and packaging adjustments, require relatively little capital to reap great gains. Other prevention strategies proposed may require a bit more initial capital, but have the power to make large-scale impacts over time.</div>

              <div class="card-text">The three most effective are donation tax incentives, standardized donation regulation, and software that matches food donations with recipient organizations in need. These solutions require both legislative and technological support, but they can make a big difference in ensuring surplus food gets to the people who need it.</div>

              <div class="card-text">food recycling has the greatest growth potential and will have a major impact on further reducing waste in the coming decades. The reason lies in the efficiency of this approach. Since food scrap volume is tied to population density, large cities can have a proportionately large impact, lessening the need to scale programs nationwide.</div>

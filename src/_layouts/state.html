          <h2>Date Labeling</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          {% assign labeling = page.policy_data.date_labeling %}
          <p class="editable">Date labels are the dates stamped on food items and accompanied by phrases such as &ldquo;sell by,&rdquo; &ldquo;use by,&rdquo; or &ldquo;best by.&rdquo; These dates are generally intended to communicate food quality, not food safety. Nevertheless, they exert a powerful influence on consumers and food vendors, who rely on these labels when deciding whether or not to throw food away. Under current federal law, date labels remain almost entirely unregulated, except for use on infant formula. States have filled this void with a variety of inconsistent date labeling regulations that often fail to reflect the distinction between food safety and food quality.<br /><br />Currently, 41 states and the District of Columbia <strong>require at least some foods to have date labels</strong>. These state date label regulations vary widely. Some state regulations require the use of labels only on narrow categories of food, while others are much broader. New Hampshire, for example, requires date labels only on cream and pre-wrapped sandwiches. In contrast, &nbsp;Massachusetts requires date labels on all pre-packaged perishable and semi-perishable food products. &nbsp;<br /><br />Twenty states and the District of Columbia <strong>prohibit or restrict sale or donation of food products once the date has passed</strong>, even when such foods are still healthy and safe to consume. These state laws also vary widely. Massachusetts and Oregon allow past-date products to be sold but require them to be clearly labeled as past-date and separated from pre-date products. Montana prohibits milk from being sold or &ldquo;otherwise offered for public consumption&rdquo; after the required &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date, which must be 12 days after pasteurization in that state.<br /><br />This patchwork state regulatory system, as well as the wide array of date labels that appear on products, contributes to confusion among consumers and regulators and ultimately results in the significant waste of safe, wholesome food.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">Many potential food donors, including grocers and retailers, cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, the federal <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ210/pdf/PLAW-104publ210.pdf">Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</a> provides a national baseline of civil and criminal liability protection for food donors and recipient nonprofit organizations that receive and distribute food to needy individuals. States cannot make laws that remove or reduce the protection created under the Act, but they are free to enact laws that are the same or even stronger.<br /><br />All 50 states have state liability protection acts, and several states provide additional liability protection above those offered by the Emerson Act. Examples of state improvements include providing protection even when nonprofit food recovery organizations charge the final recipient; protecting donors that donate directly to the final recipient; reducing unnecessary labeling requirements for liability protection for donated food; and explicitly offering protection when donors donate past-date foods. By going beyond the federal liability protection floor, states encourage food donation and help ensure more food makes it to the tables of those in need.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <p class="editable"><br />The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act provides a strong federal baseline of protection for food donors. It covers individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, the officers of businesses and nonprofit organizations, and gleaners.

          <h2>Tax Incentives</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">Tax incentives make food donation more cost-effective and economically beneficial. At the federal level, there are two tax deductions for food donations: a general deduction and an enhanced deduction. The enhanced deduction provides a significantly higher financial benefit, allowing businesses to deduct a value for donated food that is almost twice as much as the general deduction. Federal tax incentives have been extraordinarily successful in motivating food donation. For example, when the federal enhanced deduction was temporarily expanded to cover more businesses in 2005, food donations across the country rose by 137% in the following year.<br /><br />In addition to the success of the federal enhanced deduction, a growing numbers of states have passed or considered state-level tax incentives in recent years. This is because states have seen that certain businesses, such as farmers or other businesses with low profit margins, struggle to benefit from the federal tax incentive. State tax incentives provide those businesses with a more tailored incentive and a benefit that is often easier to understand and easier for businesses to utilize than the federal one. Currently, nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina and Virginia) and the District of Columbia offer such tax incentives.<br /><br />Each state&rsquo;s food landscape is different, which means tax incentives for food donations vary across state lines. For example, all states except Arizona offer tax deductions instead of tax credits. Additionally, some states offer tax incentives for different types of donors. The bulk of states provide tax incentives targeted at farmers, but some incentives are broader or entail a separate piece of legislation aimed at other food businesses.

          <h2>Animal Feed</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">For centuries, using food scraps as animal feed was common worldwide. The practice declined precipitously in the 1980s when several disease outbreaks were linked to unsafe animal feed. In an attempt to prevent the spread of such diseases, federal laws and regulations were enacted to restrict what is often pejoratively referred to as &ldquo;garbage feeding&rdquo; to animals. However, using food scraps as animal feed in a safe, resource-efficient way can be environmentally friendly and energy-efficient with multiple benefits for regional farmers and food waste generators, such as retailers, restaurants and educational institutions. Recently, interest in the practice of using a wider array of safe, properly-treated food scraps from a range of sources&mdash;including unsold retail food and post-consumer food scraps&mdash;as animal feed has been growing.<br /><br />Federal and state governments regulate the use of food scraps in animal feed by setting restrictions, which largely vary based on the type of animals that may be fed food scraps and the kind of scraps they may be fed. The federal regulations function as a floor, and most state regulations go beyond them. The majority of states (48 plus Puerto Rico) regulate the feeding of food scraps to animals, focusing mostly on swine.<br /><br />Many states have added their own more stringent regulations, and in some cases, outright bans on the practice. &nbsp;For example, 15 states ban feeding swine food scraps that contain any animal parts or material, and nine of these states even ban the feeding of vegetable waste to swine. States also have different license and heat-treatment requirements, with 12 states going above the federal rules and requiring heat-treating of vegetable-based food scraps before they are fed to swine.<br /><br />Scroll down to learn about this state&rsquo;s laws around feeding food scraps to animals.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Organic waste bans &amp; waste recycling laws</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">A growing number of states and localities are creating organic waste bans or waste recycling laws to restrict the amount of food waste an entity can dispose of in a landfill in order to push businesses and consumers to reduce food waste. Five states and several localities have passed either waste bans or waste recycling laws for food waste. Four states&mdash;Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Vermont&mdash;structure their laws as organic waste bans, while one state&mdash;California&mdash;has instituted a waste recycling law requiring commercial generators of organic waste to either compost or anaerobically digest organic waste. Each of the five states prohibits certain entities that generate specified amounts of food waste from sending this waste to landfills, subject to exceptions.<br /><br />However, each waste ban or recycling law differs in important details. For example, they vary with regard to the types of entities covered under the law, how much organic waste an entity must produce in order to be covered, and whether exceptions exist for entities located far from a certified recycling or composting facility that accepts food scraps. These differences have a significant impact on the reach of these laws, and therefore on the amount of food waste diverted from landfills. For example, the states differ widely in terms of the types of generators they cover. As of 2020, Vermont&rsquo;s law will cover anyone, including residents, who &nbsp;generates any amount of food waste. In contrast, the other states&rsquo; bans cover only certain commercial, industrial, and institutional entities, with variation among the three states.<br /><br />At the local level, a number of municipal laws exist that seek to divert food from landfills. Some of these local laws function similarly to the state laws described above.<br />&nbsp;</p>

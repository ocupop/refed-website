          <h2>Date Labeling</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          {% assign labeling = page.policy_data.date_labeling %}
          <p class="editable">Date labels are the dates stamped onto food items and accompanied by phrases such as &ldquo;sell by,&rdquo; &ldquo;use by,&rdquo; or &ldquo;best by.&rdquo; These dates are generally intended to communicate food quality, not food safety, but nevertheless exert a powerful influence on consumers and food vendors. Under current federal law, date labels remain almost entirely unregulated. (The exception is infant formula, which is required to bear a &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date indicating the date at which the nutrient content may begin to decline.) With no federal standards to unify the country&rsquo;s date labeling practices, states have filled the void with a variety of inconsistent date labeling regulations.<br /><br />Currently, 41 states and the District of Columbia <strong>require at least some foods to have date labels</strong>. These state date label regulations vary widely, and often fail to reflect the distinction between food safety and food quality. Some states require the use of labels only on narrow categories of food. New Hampshire, for example, requires date labels only on containers of cream and pre-wrapped sandwiches. Other states have much broader regulations: Massachusetts requires date labels on all prepackaged perishable and semi-perishable food products. &nbsp;<br /><br />Twenty states and the District of Columbia <strong>prohibit or restrict sale or donation of food products once the date has passed</strong>, even when such foods are still healthy and safe to consume. These state laws also vary widely. Massachusetts and Oregon allow past-date products to be sold but impose restrictions on sales, such as requiring them to be clearly labeled as past-date and separated from pre-date products. Montana, which requires milk to bear a &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; date of 12 days after pasteurization, prohibits milk from being sold or &ldquo;otherwise offered for public consumption&rdquo; after the date.<br /><br />This patchwork state regulatory system, as well as the myriad different labels that appear on products, contributes to confusion among consumers, state and local regulators, and ultimately results in the significant waste of healthy, wholesome food.<br /><br />Scroll down to learn about this state&rsquo;s date labeling laws.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <h2>Liability Protection</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">Many potential food donors, including grocers and retailers, cite fear of liability as a primary deterrent to donating food. However, businesses (including farms) and nonprofits that provide or receive donated food are generally well-protected by state and federal laws designed to provide immunity from liability related to food donations. The <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ210/pdf/PLAW-104publ210.pdf”">Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</a> provides a federal baseline of civil and criminal liability protection to a broad range of food donors and recipient nonprofit organizations that receive and distribute food to needy individuals. States cannot make laws that remove or reduce the protection created under the Act, but they are free to enact laws that are the same or even stronger.<br /><br />All 50 states have passed state liability protection acts, and several states have improved upon the protections afforded by the Emerson Act by providing additional liability protection above those offered in the federal law. Examples of state improvements include providing protection even when nonprofit food recovery organizations charge the final recipient; protecting donors that donate directly to the final recipient; removing labeling requirements for liability protection for donated food; and explicitly offering protection when donors donate past-date foods. Additionally, in order to clarify and advertise these protections, some states publish guidance about federal and state liability protections for food donations. By going beyond the federal liability protection floor, or undertaking education and awareness efforts, states encourage food donation and help ensure more food makes it to the tables of those in need.<br /><br />Scroll down to learn about this state&rsquo;s liability protections for food donations.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Federal Liability Protection</h3>
          <p class="editable">The Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act provides a strong federal baseline of protection for food donors. It covers individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, the officers of businesses and nonprofit organizations, and gleaners. A donor must donate in good faith to a nonprofit organization that distributes the donated food to needy populations, and the food must meet all quality and labeling standards imposed by federal, state and local laws and regulations.</p>

          <h2>Tax Incentives</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p class="editable">Tax incentives make food donation more cost-effective and economically beneficial. At the federal level, there are two tax deductions for food donations: a general deduction and an enhanced deduction. The enhanced deduction provides a significantly higher financial benefit, allowing businesses to deduct a value for donated food that is almost twice as much as the general deduction. Federal tax incentives have been extraordinarily successful in motivating food donation. For example, when the federal enhanced deduction was temporarily expanded to cover more businesses in 2005, food donations across the country rose by 137% in the following year.<br /><br />In addition to the success of the federal enhanced deduction, a growing numbers of states have passed or considered state-level tax incentives in recent years. This is because states have seen that certain businesses, such as farmers or other businesses with low profit margins, struggle to benefit from the federal tax incentive. State tax incentives provide those businesses with a more tailored incentive and a benefit that is often easier to understand and easier for businesses to utilize than the federal one. Currently, nine states (Arizona, California, Colorado, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Oregon, South Carolina and Virginia) and the District of Columbia offer such tax incentives.<br /><br />Each state&rsquo;s food landscape is different, which means tax incentives for food donations vary across state lines. For example, all states except Arizona offer tax deductions instead of tax credits. Additionally, some states offer tax incentives for different types of donors. The bulk of states provide tax incentives targeted at farmers, but some incentives are broader or entail a separate piece of legislation aimed at other food businesses.<br /><br />Scroll down to learn about this state&rsquo;s tax incentives for food donations.<br />&nbsp;</p>

          <h3>Federal Tax Incentives</h3>
          <p class="editable">The federal government provides tax deductions to incentivize businesses to donate food. As of December 2015, all businesses—including C-corporations, S-corporations, limited liability corporations (LLCs), partnerships and sole proprietorships—are eligible for an enhanced tax deduction that exceeds the property’s basis for donated food if they meet certain requirements. If they do not meet the requirements, they can still claim a general tax deduction in the amount of the property’s basis.</p>

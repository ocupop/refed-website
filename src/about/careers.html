  - title: We Take Inspiration From Design Thinking
    description_html: >-
      <p>We hire incredible people with a ‘can-do’ attitude that are hungry, passionate, and love new challenges. We embrace the idea that if we’re not continuously iterating and adapting — we are not evolving. Ultimately, “progress not perfection” is what we strive for by fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.</p>

  - title: We Encourage Mutual Respect and Recognition
    description_html: >-
      <p>Respect is the hallmark of working at ReFED. We use the platinum rule: do unto others as they would have you do unto them. In doing so, we recognize that the best decisions are made when a diverse range of voices are heard and acknowledged. Hence, we aim to understand and apply our teammates’ expertise and experience, as well as actively seeking ways to help each other grow.</p>

  - title: We Work as a Team and Lift Up Our Teammates
    description_html: >-
      <p>Above all, we thrive because we work as a team and celebrate success as a team.
        That means we show up for each other, act with empathy, and bring our authentic selves to work every day. We empower our employees in a work environment that is flexible and conducive to creating space for true time off, and that fosters a sense of belonging, participation, and commitment among employees.</p>

          Our Equity Commitment
        </h3>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>ReFED, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that everyone has a seat at the table, and that this table always has room for growth. The success of our organization is rooted in the visible and invisible qualities of our people, who embody a variety of views, perspectives, and backgrounds to push the envelope of what&rsquo;s possible and better meet the needs of our community in the hopes of building a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food system. Community is more than a word here. As stewards of this food system &mdash; one that benefits from the inclusion and enhancement of diverse voices &mdash; we recognize that systemic barriers limit opportunities for certain groups which contributes to ongoing disparities. Furthermore, we accept that our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) means a commitment to constant learning, listening, and iteration in all aspects of our work.</p>
          <p>Intrinsically, we are an organization that seeks to attract exceptional and dedicated talent to advance our mission, and that firmly believes that inclusion through recruiting, hiring, developing, training, and promoting employees of all genders, races, religions, ages, national origin, political affiliations, ancestries, sexual orientations, disabilities, and veteran status, creates an atmosphere that enables us to lead with an entrepreneurial spirit and innovate with enterprise. The time for action to reduce food waste is now. Let&rsquo;s work together to advance data-driven solutions.</p>

          Our Equity Commitment
        </h3>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>ReFED, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer. We believe that everyone has a seat at the table, and that this table always has room for growth. The success of our organization is rooted in the visible and invisible qualities of our people, who embody a variety of views, perspectives, and backgrounds to push the envelope of what&rsquo;s possible and better meet the needs of our community in the hopes of building a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food system. Community is more than a word here. As stewards of this food system &mdash; one that benefits from the inclusion and enhancement of diverse voices &mdash; we recognize that systemic barriers limit opportunities for certain groups which contributes to ongoing disparities. Furthermore, we accept that our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) means a commitment to constant learning, listening, and iteration in all aspects of our work.</p>
          <p>Intrinsically, we are an organization that seeks to attract exceptional and dedicated talent to advance our mission, and that firmly believes that inclusion through recruiting, hiring, developing, training, and promoting employees of all genders, races, religions, ages, national origin, political affiliations, ancestries, sexual orientations, disabilities, and veteran status, creates an atmosphere that enables us to lead with an entrepreneurial spirit and innovate with enterprise. The time for action to reduce food waste is now. Let&rsquo;s work together to advance data-driven solutions.</p>

  summary: >-
    Jesse Fink is a venture philanthropist who has dedicated the past two
    decades to working on solutions to climate change and other environmental
    issues. Jesse and his wife, Betsy, first became interested in food waste as
    a solvable issue from their hands-on experience operating Millstone Farm, a
    farm Betsy established in Wilton, CT. They soon realized that reducing food
    waste at scale would have a game-changing impact on climate change, natural
    resource depletion, and food insecurity. In 2014, the Fink Family Foundation
    commissioned MissionPoint Partners, an impact investment management company
    co-founded by Jesse, to created a roadmap for a systems-based approach to
    solving food waste in the United States. ReFED was then incubated by
    MissionPoint Partners and launched as a stand-alone organization in 2015.
    Jesse served as inaugural Board Chair until 2020 and remains an active board
    member of ReFED.

          ReFED launched in 2015 as a collaboration of more than 30 industry, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing food waste in the United States. We were formed to create <em>A Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste by 20 Percent</em>, the first ever national economic analysis and action plan to tackle the issue at-scale. The <em>Roadmap </em>was designed to fill the gap between awareness and action by creating transparency in the waste flows, costs, and opportunities of a more efficient food system. These frameworks and methodologies have been adopted by over 20 organizations, including Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Canada, Walmart, Deloitte, and Johns Hopkins University. ReFED has since evolved into one of the nation&rsquo;s leading organizations working to build a more sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food system.

  summary: >-
    Jesse Fink is a venture philanthropist who has dedicated the past two
    decades to working on solutions to climate change and other environmental
    issues. Jesse and his wife, Betsy, first became interested in food waste as
    a solvable issue from their hands-on experience operating Millstone Farm, a
    farm Betsy established in Wilton, CT. They soon realized that reducing food
    waste at scale would have a game-changing impact on climate change, natural
    resource depletion, and food insecurity. In 2014, the Fink Family Foundation
    commissioned MissionPoint Partners, an impact investment management company
    co-founded by Jesse, to created a roadmap for a systems-based approach to
    solving food waste in the United States. ReFED was then incubated by
    MissionPoint Partners and launched as a stand-alone organization in 2015.
    Jesse served as inaugural Board Chair until 2020 and remains an active board
    member of ReFED.

          ReFED was launched in 2015 as a collaboration between more than 30 business, nonprofit, foundation, and government leaders committed to reducing food waste in the United States. We created solutions for which were projected to catalyze tens of thousands of new jobs, recover billions of meals annually for the hungry, and reduce national water use and greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <div class="editable">
          <p>ReFED was formed to create <em>The Ro</em><em>admap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste</em>, the first ever national economic study and action plan driven by a multi-stakeholder group committed to tackling food waste at scale. The Roadmap was designed to fill the gap between awareness and action by creating transparency in the waste flows, costs, and opportunities of a more efficient food system achieved by preventing, recovering, and recycling food waste.</p>
          <p>In 2018, we launched our signature annual event, the Food Waste Summit (originally held in partnership with the Harvard Food Law and Policy Center), providing an opportunity for leaders from across the food system to share insights, ideas, and inspiration.</p>
          <p>In 2019, ReFED became a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. With more than a dozen employees located across the US and Canada, we are proud to play a central role in facilitating a reduction in food waste.</p>

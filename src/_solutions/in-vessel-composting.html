definition: "Composting at small-scale at institutions or businesses with heat and mechanical power to compost relatively quickly (less than one month versus more than two months for windrow composting)"


challenges:
  - Equipment is relatively expensive.
  - Use requires managing a small composting operation in addition to primary business operations.
  - Since these units are most effective at sites with both a large supply of food scraps and large demand for compost, this technology is likely to continue to occupy a niche market.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Case studies can be developed for application at the strongest target customers: universities, sports facilities, farm-to-table restaurants, and small grocery stores.
  - Entrepreneurs can continue to innovate to bring down the cost of equipment and automate operation.

examples:
  - title:
    description: <a href='http://forsolutionsllc.com/case-study/' target='_blank'>For Solutions LLC</a> installed an in-vessel composting machine at a large university and saved the university $25,000 in trash-hauling fees while producing compost to use for local landscaping.

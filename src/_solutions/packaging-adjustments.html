definition: "Modifying packaging sizes and designs to optimize consumer consumption and avoid residual container waste"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - There is a lack of data; both consumer demand and the potential for waste reduction are uncertain for many packaging sizes and configurations.
  - Although easy grab-n-go snack packs are widely available, most other standard packaging has not been changed to minimize waste.   
  - Large bulk packaging can market lower net unit costs, often encouraging consumers to over purchase in the hopes of achieving net savings.
  - Packaging that reduces food waste may have other environmental trade-offs, such as higher net packaging volume or use of materials that are more challenging to recycle.
  - Smaller packaging sizes can have unintended consequences by increasing SKUs and inventory needs.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Nonprofits, academia, manufacturers, and trade associations can conduct consumer insights research on smaller and unique packaging configurations and current levels of over purchasing of bulk pack sizes in search of deals.
  - Universities and accelerators can launch competitions to identify the latest packaging innovations.
  - Manufacturers and other food businesses can support entrepreneurs by engaging as pilot customers.

    description: In the U.K., bread was identified as one of the most thrown away items. One manufacturer, Kingsmill, recently introduced their “<a href="http://www.bakeryinfo.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/13858/Bread_tops_food_waste_list,_finds_study.html" target="_blank">Little Big Loaf</a>”, a smaller, more manageable size designed to decrease the amount of bread wasted.

Target products include ketchup and mayonnaise bottles.

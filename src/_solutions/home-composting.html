definition: "Keeping a small bin or pile for on-site waste at residential buildings to be managed locally; also known as &quot;backyard composting&quot;"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - After a few months, consumers may not maintain their compost pile.
  - For apartment dwellers or those in cold climates, it may be challenging to find a convenient location for the compost bin. 

stakeholder-actions:
  - Cities that donâ€™t offer curbside composting pick-up can provide grants or <a href='http://www.cityoforlando.net/solidwaste/composter/' target='_blank'>free systems</a>, which should pay for themselves within three to five years through reduced collection costs and tipping fees.
  - The <em>Roadmap</em> estimates that 750,000 new households could feasibly begin home composting, which would require a massive consumer education and marketing campaign.
  - Consumers can create or purchase their own composting system. Typical costs range from free (utilize backyard materials) to $100.

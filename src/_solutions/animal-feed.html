definition: "Feeding food waste to animals after it is heat treated and dehydrated and either mixed with dry feed or directly fed"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Hog and cattle farmers can substitute treated food waste for commercial feeds to reduce costs.
  - The vast majority of waste appropriate for use in animal feed <a href='http://www.foodwastealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/FWRA_BSR_Tier3_FINAL.pdf' target='_blank'>is already being used</a>. 
  - Expensive dewatering and treatment equipment is needed at a transfer station to process mixed food scraps into something appropriate for animals, according to our interview with a national food waste logistics company.
  - Finding locations with proximity to large generators as well as large animal production operations is tough, according to our interview with a national food waste logistics company.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Entrepreneurs and waste haulers could create a dynamic network to match food waste generators with nearby farms.
  - New research into animal nutrition may unlock additional potential, as most livestock managers seek feed sources with consistent nutritional qualities to ensure a balanced diet.

  Standardizing food label dates, including eliminating visible “sell by” dates,
  to reduce consumer confusion
overview: >-
  Current date labeling practices on food packaging cause confusion with
  “sell-by,” “best-by,” “use-by,” and “best before” dates, leading up to 90% of
  Americans to occasionally throw out still-fresh food. Confusion over the
  meaning of date labels <a
  href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/ES%20Technical%20report%20dates_0.pdf"
  target="_blank">is estimated</a> to account for 20% of consumer waste of safe,
  edible food. This equates to approximately $29 billion of wasted consumer
  spending each year — 5% to 10% of this is expected to be impacted by
  standardized date labels.
challenges:
  - >-
    There is no comprehensive national regulation or government agency with the
    direct mandate <a
    href="http://www.nrdc.org/food/files/dating-game-report.pdf"
    target="_blank">to regulate food date labeling</a> for safety and
    perishability.
  - >-
    Consumers face a confusing array of labels and phrasing that differ widely
    based on varied state laws and manufacturer preferences.
  - >-
    The cost for changing the date labels is negligible, but manufacturers have
    little incentive to change their practices because date label
    standardization would do little to lower costs, increase revenues, or reduce
    liability.
  - >-
    Retailers could push for standardization from manufacturers, but would need
    to collaborate with others to represent enough market share to drive
    manufacturers to change. There may be an opportunity for retailers to reduce
    operational and food costs associated with pulling near-expired product from
    shelves. Additional research is needed to quantify this potential benefit.
  - >-
    Retailers and manufacturers consistently cite uncertainty regarding the
    design of standardized labels and wording, as well as skepticism of its
    widespread impact on consumer behavior, as two reasons for not moving
    forward on a voluntary approach.
  - >-
    Nineteen states restrict sale of products after the date on the label has
    passed, even though the majority have no safety risk associated with the
    date. In addition to wasted food, this leads to fines when retailers have
    past-date products in their stores.
stakeholder-actions:
  - >-
    Changes to date labels require little upfront investment from businesses and
    can be enacted unilaterally by large food companies to reduce consumer
    confusion. The best path forward is for a voluntary agreement of
    manufacturers to implement consistent language.
  - >-
    If a voluntary agreement is not forthcoming, a multi-stakeholder approach is
    recommended to overcome inertia and achieve true standardization. This
    multi-stakeholder approach should aim to de-risk any industry concerns by
    working with consumer behavior experts to determine the best language for
    labels, develop a process for measuring if the implemented change is leading
    to the desired results, and fund consumer education to go alongside the
    change.
  - >-
    In the absence of a voluntary commitment from industry, ReFED recommends
    that the federal government update existing FDA regulations to standardize
    date label wording. The federal government could also fund consumer
    education about these new date labeling practices in partnership with other
    private and public sector organizations.
  - >-
    In addition, states should revoke restrictions on sale or donation after the
    date on the label. This could also be achieved through federal legislation.
examples:
  - title: Food Recovery Act
    description: >-
      The <a href="https://pingree.house.gov/foodwaste/billtext"
      target="_blank">Food Recovery Act</a>, currently proposed and pending (as
      of February 2016) by Rep. Chellie Pingree, recommends standardizing labels
      with the phrase “Best if Used By,” followed by “Manufacturer’s Suggestion
      Only” and a standard “Expires On” date required for the small number of
      items determined by the FDA to have food safety risks.
  - title: Voluntary Changes
    description: >-
      Some manufacturers have experimented with adding “freeze by” language onto
      packaging to encourage customers to take active steps to preserve food in
      the freezer instead of throwing it in the trash.

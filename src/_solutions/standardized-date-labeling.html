definition: "Standardizing food label dates, including eliminating visible “sell by” dates, to reduce consumer confusion"

overview: Current date labeling practices on food packaging cause confusion with “sell-by,” “best-by,” “use-by,” and “best before” dates, leading up to 90% of Americans to occasionally throw out still-fresh food. Confusion over the meaning of date labels <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/ES%20Technical%20report%20dates_0.pdf" target="_blank">is estimated</a> to account for 20% of consumer waste of safe, edible food. This equates to approximately $29 billion of wasted consumer spending each year — 5% to 10% of this is expected to be impacted by standardized date labels.

challenges:
  - There is no comprehensive national regulation or government agency with the direct mandate <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/food/files/dating-game-report.pdf" target="_blank">to regulate food date labeling</a> for safety and perishability.
  - Consumers face a confusing array of labels and phrasing that differ widely based on varied state laws and manufacturer preferences.
  - The cost for changing the date labels is negligible, but manufacturers have little incentive to change their practices because date label standardization would do little to lower costs, increase revenues, or reduce liability.
  - Retailers could push for standardization from manufacturers, but would need to collaborate with others to represent enough market share to drive manufacturers to change. There may be an opportunity for retailers to reduce operational and food costs associated with pulling near-expired product from shelves. Additional research is needed to quantify this potential benefit.
  - Retailers and manufacturers consistently cite uncertainty regarding the design of standardized labels and wording, as well as skepticism of its widespread impact on consumer behavior, as two reasons for not moving forward on a voluntary approach.
  - Nineteen states restrict sale of products after the date on the label has passed, even though the majority have no safety risk associated with the date. In addition to wasted food, this leads to fines when retailers have past-date products in their stores.

stakeholder-actions:
  - Changes to date labels require little upfront investment from businesses and can be enacted unilaterally by large food companies to reduce consumer confusion. The best path forward is for a voluntary agreement of <strong>manufacturers</strong> to implement consistent language.
  - If a voluntary agreement is not forthcoming, a <a href="{{ '' | }}">multi-stakeholder approach</a> is recommended to overcome inertia and achieve true standardization.

  - <p>A working group forms among retailers, manufacturers, nonprofits, and consumer behavior experts to align around the success metrics for a wide-scale date labeling pilot.</p>
  - <p>Retailers and manufacturers commit to implementing date labels at scale if a pilot is successful and a process for scaling is feasible.</p>
  - <p>Researchers analyze consumer behavior to determine the ideal phrasing for date labels that will reduce confusion, while ensuring items with a food safety risk have separate labeling reflecting this concern.</p>
  - <p>Academics and nonprofits partner to conduct baseline studies and measure ongoing impacts to enable pre- and post-evaluation of date label changes.</p>
  - <p>Retailers and manufacturers coordinate to pilot, while nonprofits drive customer awareness on the change through educational campaigns.</p>
  - <p>A wider group of retailers and manufacturers collectively scale the standardized labeling across the country.</p>

  - In the absence of a voluntary commitment from industry, ReFED recommends that the federal government update existing FDA regulations to standardize date label wording. The federal government could also fund consumer education about these new date labeling practices in partnership with other private and public sector organizations.
  - In addition, states should revoke restrictions on sale or donation after the date label. This could also be achieved through federal legislation.

examples:
  - title: Food Recovery Act
    description: The <a href="https://pingree.house.gov/foodwaste/billtext" target="_blank">Food Recovery Act</a>, currently proposed and pending (as of February 2016) by Rep. Chellie Pingree, recommends standardizing labels with the phrase “Best if Used By,” followed by “Manufacturer’s Suggestion Only” and a standard “Expires On” date required for the small number of items determined by the FDA to have food safety risks.
  - title: Voluntary Changes
    description: Some manufacturers have experimented with adding “freeze by” language onto packaging to encourage customers to take active steps to preserve food in the freezer instead of throwing it in the trash.

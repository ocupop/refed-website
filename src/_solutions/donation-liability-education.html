definition: "Educating potential food donors on donation liability laws"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - The federal <a href='http://www.feedingamerica.org/ways-to-give/give-food/become-a-product-partner/protecting-our-food-partners.html' target='_blank'>Good Samaritan Food Donation Act</a> protects donors and recipients from civil or criminal liability short of gross negligence and misconduct. However, this legislation remains unproven and untested in court, leaving corporate legal departments without a precedent to follow that would allow them to fully support food donation.
  - It is challenging to create scalable solutions, which requires awareness campaigns and educational materials to change mindsets for a wide variety of businesses.
  - The high turnover of staff requires ongoing training to be effective.

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Federal government</strong> can provide additional guidance on the Good Samaritan Act to increase clarity for businesses.
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> can develop training guides for businesses.
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> can publicly recognize business leaders to get buy-in from other executives and sponsor peer-to-peer business networking events to dispel liability concerns.
  - <strong>Businesses</strong> can include information on donation as a standard set of employee on-boarding trainings.
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> and <strong>researchers</strong> can provide research to develop a simple data-driven framework for businesses to evaluate food-safety risks.

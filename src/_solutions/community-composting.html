definition: "Transporting food from homes by truck, car, or bicycle to small, community, or neighborhood-level compost facilities that process 2,500 tons per year on average"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Programs often struggle to be financially viable and need to charge homeowners and businesses a direct subscription fee to support the collection of material.
  - Programs typically use volunteers and less sophisticated equipment, which can reduce quality of output and increase processing time.
  - The total capital needed to add 140 programs is expected to cost over $60 million, roughly $380 per ton of food composted, which is much higher than larger-scale compost facilities.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Communities can utilize excess land near community gardens, schools, or even other waste-management infrastructure to set up composting sites. 
  - Colocating composting sites with other community assets will enhance Non-Financial Benefits such as job creation, food access, and educational opportunities for children. 
  - Foundations and local governments can provide grant funding to support site development, resulting in environmental and community benefits.

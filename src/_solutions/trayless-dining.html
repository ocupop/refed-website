definition: "Eliminating trays in all-you-can-eat dining facilities to reduce over-portioning by consumers"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Retrofits to tray and plate returns are often needed if cafeterias and seating areas are separated by stairs or a sizeable distance, requiring consumers to walk further distances while balancing plates. These can cost $10,000 to $25,000 per facility, but many institutions lack upfront capital to pay for them.
  - Since trayless dining has been widely adopted by larger facilities, the remaining opportunity requires change within smaller facilities or those more resistant to change, including 10% of self-serve buffet restaurants and 40% of cafeterias and dining halls.

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Foodservice providers</strong> can develop a loan fund, similar to revolving energy efficiency loan funds, to help pay for the upfront costs from institutions and be repaid through cost savings.
  - <strong>Student campaigns</strong> at universities can ask their food service managers to remove trays from the dining halls to promote the benefits of food waste reduction.
  - Education to <strong>consumers</strong> must be paired with any switch to trayless dining to reduce consumer complaints about the switch.

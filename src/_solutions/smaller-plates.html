  - title:
    description: Cornell Professor Brian Wansinkâ€™s <a href='http://foodpsychology.cornell.edu/outreach/large-plates.html' target='_blank'>research</a> on food psychology found that consumers given larger bowls took (and consumed) 16% more cereal than those with smaller bowls. Consumers generally find a 70% fill rate to be &ladquo;visually pleasing&radquo;, so smaller plates reduce the amount of food consumers serves themselves.

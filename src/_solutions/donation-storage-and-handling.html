definition: "Expanding temperature-controlled food distribution infrastructure (e.g. refrigeration, warehouses) and labor availability to handle (e.g. process, package) additional food donation volume"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Each warehouse serves a unique local need, which requires a regionalized understanding of food distribution capabilities and gaps.
  - It can be difficult to finance warehouses that are operational and capital-intense but lack significant collateral. 

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Food banks</strong> can expand existing infrastructure to increase handling capacity for perishables.
  - The network of over 200 <strong>U.S. food hubs</strong>, which aggregate and market locally grown food by providing storage, handling, and processing capabilities, can use excess capacity to store and handle donated food.
  - <strong>Foundations</strong> can provide low-cost infrastructure funding in addition to existing grants for food recovery overhead and operational expenses. Funding can also be directed toward mapping where underutilized assets exist, such as, surplus refrigerator space within existing businesses or nonprofits.
  - Nontraditional transportation and storage is needed. Ride-sharing services such as Uber or Lyft can provide near real-time transportation, as they do with food delivery, for donated food that must be picked up within hours. Similarly, since donated food often becomes available for recovery at night when many food banks are not open, other late-night businesses with refrigerated capacity may be available to hold food until the next morning.

    description: The <a href='http://www.foodbanknega.org/about' target='_blank'>Food Bank of Northeast Georgia</a> recently secured $4.8 million from businesses and foundations to build a state-of-the-art donation facility with over 6,000 sq. feet of freezer and cooler space.
  - title:
    description: The Second Harvest Food Bank of Middle Tennessee provided a Feeding America Produce Capacity Grant to Hughes Farm and Produce to cover the cost of installing a <a href='http://www.tennessean.com/story/sponsor-story/second-harvest-food-bank/2015/11/18/green-bean-project-reduces-waste-feeds-hungry-families/75988104/' target='_blank'>new processing line</a> to sort green beans that were too short, long, or misshapen for retail standards but could be donated. The upgrade cost less than $50,000, and Second Harvest expects to recover 1 million pounds of green beans per year at scale.

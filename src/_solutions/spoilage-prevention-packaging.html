definition: "Packaging technologies that actively slow fruit and meat spoilage through ethylene absorption and other techniques"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Enhanced shelf life and the associated reduction in food waste from spoilage prevention packaging is highly variable for each food type. To prove that the impact is broad, pilots need to be conducted across many product categories.
  - Businesses must pay for the product enhancement, but they may not see the direct savings if shelf life is only extended for consumers.
  - The extent to which consumers will pay more for products with longer shelf life is untested, which may require the extra cost to be borne by the retailer.

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Retailers</strong> and <strong>manufacturers</strong> can use pilots to test consumer willingness to pay higher prices for this packaging along with the cost benefits from extended shelf life.
  - <strong>Investors</strong> can fund technology innovators to bring down costs and invest in consumer marketing to spur demand.

definition: "Providing small-scale transportation infrastructure for local recovery as well as long-haul transport capabilities"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - The cost of short-distance, small-load transportation is expensive per pound compared to long-haul transportation of larger loads.
  - Perishables need to be distributed quickly and efficiently to maintain freshness.
  - Transportation costs are typically covered by food recovery organizations, which often operate with small budgets.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Retailers and foodservice distributors can partner with recovery organizations to share their excess transportation capacity.
  - Foundations and government can provide grants or low-cost loans for transportation financing, especially for physical assets such as trucks and the cost of trucking services.
  - Rural recovery groups can build connections with other rural support services, including health care and education services, to help cost-effectively distribute food through existing channels.
  - Recovery organizations can improve coordination with other nonprofits to find a home for donated food that they cannot use due to capacity or budgetary constraints. By coordinating, nonprofits can also achieve economies of scale to ensure that trucks are fully loaded with food and do not have spare capacity.

Borderlands redistributes this food throughout the U.S., with hunger-relief organizations paying two pennies per pound for long-haul transportation. This can equate to <a href='https://thefern.org/2015/04/borderlands-food-bank-cutting-food-waste-at-the-border/' target='_blank'>less than $1,000 per truckload</a> for $70,000 worth of product.

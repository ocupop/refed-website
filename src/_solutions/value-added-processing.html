definition: "Building processing infrastructure equipment and facilities to freeze or convert donated or excess food into products such as soups, sauces, and jams"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Processing requires capital-intensive commercial kitchens and other infrastructure.
  - During prime harvesting season, existing infrastructure capacity is often not available, requiring new infrastructure to be built or identified in the community.

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> and <stronn>social entrepreneurs</strong> can work with farmers and manufacturers in food-producing regions to find excess processing capacity to handle crop surpluses during prime harvesting months, and collaborate with businesses to process donated food.
  - <strong>Foundations</strong> and <strong>impact investors</strong> can provide low-cost capital for investment in additional processing line capacity.
  - The <strong>USDA</strong> could expand its grant and loan programs to help farmers and entrepreneurs invest in their own processing capabilities.

    description: "While the <em>Roadmap</em> focused on more mature nonprofit efforts to preserve the lifespan of donated food through processing, several social enterprises have emerged recently to sell value-added product from food waste at a profit. These include <a href='http://barnana.com' target='_blank'>Barnana</a> (snack bites from bananas rejected for export/import), <a href='http://misfitjuicery.co' target='_blank'>Misfit Juicery</a> (a juice company repurposing wasted food), and <a href='http://mmlocalfoods.com' target='_blank'>MM Local Foods</a> (which buys seconds from farmers and makes value-added products to sell)."

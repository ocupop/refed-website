definition: "Target systemic and sporadic waste generation by optimizing equipment operating conditions (e.g. determining the most efficient run settings), addressing production line design flaws, modifying production schedules to minimize changeovers, and identifying novel ways to repurpose discarded food for sale"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Each plant and product line is unique with different opportunities for waste reduction, leading to difficulties identifying widespread solutions.
  - Many of the most obvious waste prevention opportunities have already been implemented as cost-savings initiatives. 

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Manufacturersâ€™</strong> internal action teams can identify waste reduction opportunities, including holding competitions among facilities that incentivize workers to reduce waste.
  - <strong>Manufacturers</strong> can enhance existing worker training programs to include a food waste identification component and develop programs to reward proactive employee behavior

definition: "Increase the use of direct, point-to-point perishable food shipments from farmers to retailers to reduce the number of stops a product makes in transit and develop a cold chain certification standard for food carriers"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - The food logistics industry is highly fragmented.
  - Retailers lack a financial incentive to act, since they typically can pass the cost of rejected food as a loss back to the shipper or supplier.
  - Smaller suppliers and distributors are motivated to reduce losses but lack the scale, financial capacity, and time to implement new practices. 


stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Retailers</strong> and <strong>manufacturers</strong> can develop performance standards related to cold chain management excellence.
  - Large <strong>retailers</strong> can create demand for better cold chain practices among the fragmented logistics industry, similar to how Walmart uses its buying power to pressure its suppliers to change business practices.
  - <strong>Academic studies</strong> can analyze the business case for how point-to-point food shipments minimize temperature-related losses during transit.
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> or <strong>industry players</strong> can develop a cold chain certification system that outlines best practices and holds businesses accountable for avoiding preventable waste.

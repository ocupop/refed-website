definition: "An on-site treatment technology, greywater aerobic digesters use combinations of nutrients or enzymes and bacteria to break food organics down until soluble, where it is flushed into the sewage system"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Units are expensive, ranging from $40,000 to $75,000, and are more popular in Europe and East Asia where higher landfill fees offer a faster economic payback than in the U.S. 
  - There is limited transparency of biological processes and the nature of material going down the drain, which is a major concern of municipal water authorities responsible for preventing pipe clogs and running WRRFs. 
  - These units can be controversial since they do not fully digest the food scraps and may require additional processing by WRRFs, which may or may not have the capacity for processing in place.
  - Units require electricity to operate and release greenhouse gases during partial digestion, leading to uncertainty regarding environmental impacts.


stakeholder-actions:
  - Nonprofits and manufacturers can conduct additional research on biological processes and potential environmental impacts to ensure commercial greywater systems do not have adverse and unintended impacts. 
  - Large restaurants or cafeterias can research whether a three- to five-year payback period is achievable through waste collection savings.

definition: "Accepting and integrating the sale of off-grade produce (short shelf life, different size/shape/color), also known as &quot;imperfect produce&quot;, into food business menu planning and product lines"

overview: ""

challenges:
  - Retail, restaurant, and foodservice buyers are often unfamiliar with cost-saving opportunities associated with buying imperfect produce and are not offered it by their suppliers. Education is needed on how such products could replace (foodservice) or supplement (retail) existing produce purchasing.
  - Some retailers have concerns about the impact of imperfect produce on their brands.
  - Creativity is needed in menu planning for foodservice and institutions.
  - Economics for farmers are unclear, since cosmetically imperfect produce may partially cannibalize sales for top-tier, cosmetically perfect products.

stakeholder-actions:
  - <strong>Businesses</strong> can set up pilots to partner with individual farmers and distributors to assess the economics and culinary dynamics of utilizing imperfect produce.
  - <strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> and existing <strong>produce suppliers</strong> can support sourcing, differentiated marketing and branding, and innovative processing for imperfect produce. 
  - <strong>Foundations</strong> and <strong>USDA grants</strong> can cover initial costs and farm labor training, support marketing and educational efforts to farmers and consumers to stimulate adequate supply and demand for imperfect produce.
  - <strong>State and federal governments</strong> can include stipulations in purchasing contracts to support the purchase of cosmetically imperfect products.
  - <strong>Nonprofits</strong> and <strong>entrepreneurs</strong> can bring understanding of the labor and harvesting challenges that farms face, based on their existing gleaning and seconds programs, to uncover new market opportunities.

definition: Improvements in the ability of retail inventory management systems to track an average productâ€™s remaining shelf-life (time left to sell an item) and inform efforts to reduce days on hand (how long an item has gone unsold)
challenges:
  - 'Current systems are optimized for minimizing stock-outs, not measuring and managing food waste. Therefore, managers optimize to ensure food is left over on the shelf.'
  - 'Although larger retailers and national chains typically use inventory management systems, it has not been seen as cost-effective among smaller retailers.'
stakeholder-actions:
  - '<strong>Retailers</strong> can increase the effectiveness of inventory management systems by adding data on food donation levels as well as the quantity of any food waste and reasons for being disposed.'
  - '<strong>Retailers</strong> can use inventory systems to help set corporate and individual buyer and store manager goals to reduce waste levels.'
  - '<strong>Retailers</strong> can develop better forecasting and share the data transparently throughout the supply chain to better match supply and demand.'

  title: Covid-19
  summary: COVID-19 has sent shock waves through our entire food system — from producers to end recipients — resulting in a surge of on-farm food loss, food business closures, labor shortages, and a growing number of food insecure individuals. By leveraging our central role as a convening organization within the food waste space, ReFED launched several funding initiatives, webinar series, and resource guides to inspire collaborations between businesses, innovators, funders, and, service organizations to help them adapt to this new reality.

          Rethinking food waste through economics and data — it is in our name and in our DNA. Along with hundreds of food system actors, we have been actively transforming the way we understand and work within the food system by providing the nation’s most comprehensive insights on food waste solutions. From the original 27 solutions analyzed in the Roadmap to the forthcoming new solutions set generated by the Insights Engine, ReFED serves as a trusted voice for the sector, distinctive in our aim to leverage data to promote a sustainable, resilient, and inclusive food system.
